## Replication 

To reproduce the project, start by cloning the repository: 
`$ git clone https://github.com/pc852/Argument-Mining-Presidential-Debates.git`

Next, we recommend running the experiments from Jupyter Notebook environment. 

To replicate the project, you will need `Python` version 3.7 or higher, and the following packages: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `numpy`, `spacy`, `vadersentiment`. Our versions for them can be found [here](https://github.com/pc852/Argument-Mining-Presidential-Debates/blob/main/code/requirements.txt).

Each notebook is tailored to be run independently when needed, however, you might need some additional preparations for certain experimental settings.

[Dataset](https://github.com/ElecDeb60To16/Dataset) is kept here, but for all the experiments you will need only [this](https://github.com/pc852/Argument-Mining-Presidential-Debates/blob/main/data/sentence_db_candidate.csv) file.
