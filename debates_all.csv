956,"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon.",None
978,"In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.",None
1098,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.",Premise
1375,"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.",Claim
1538,"We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.",Claim
1717,"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.",Premise
1870,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.,Premise
1929,But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.,Premise
2037,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",Claim
2183,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",None
2308,"If we fail, then freedom fails.",None
2340,"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?",Claim
2438,Are we as strong as we should be?,None
2472,"Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?",None
2693,"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",Claim
2837,"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.",Claim
2986,I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.,Claim
3061,I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.,Claim
3201,Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.,Premise
3351,"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.",Premise

4128,I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.,Claim
4246,I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.,Claim
4354,"Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.",Premise
4671,"These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.",None
4790,I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.,Claim
4868,If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.,Premise
5051,He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.,Premise
5126,"He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.",Premise

5357,I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.,Claim
5414,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.,None
5494,I don't at all.,Claim
5510,I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.,Claim
5565,And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.,Claim
5619,But I think there is also a national responsibility.,Claim
5672,The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.,None
5772,The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.,None
5894,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",None
6143,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.",None
6394,"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.",Claim
6477,And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.,Claim
6566,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.,None
6616,I think we can do a better job.,Claim
6648,I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.,Premise
6783,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,None
6827,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.",None
6894,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.,Claim
6970,The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.,None
7094,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.,Premise
7156,I want us to recapture that image.,Claim
7191,"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.",Claim
7427,That is the obligation upon our generation.,Claim
7471,"In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.",Premise
7586,I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.,Claim
7647,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?,Premise
7749,I think it can be.,Claim
7768,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,Claim
7835,I think it's time America started moving again.,Claim
7890,And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.,None
7963,"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy.",None
7991,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.,None
8059,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.,Claim
8236,"There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.",Premise
8413,"We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.",Claim
8488,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.",None
8560,"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",Claim
8698,"Where, then, do we disagree?",None
8727,I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.,Claim
8928,"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.",Premise
9078,"Now last year, of course, was 1958.",None
9114,That happened to be a recession year.,None
9152,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.,Premise
9193,"this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.",Claim
9314,More about that later.,None
9337,"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",Claim
9546,Is the United States standing still?,None
9583,"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",Premise
9717,"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",Premise
9878,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make.",None
9923,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.,None
10062,"When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",Premise
10211,Let's take schools.,None
10231,"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.",Claim
10389,Let's take hydroelectric power.,None
10421,We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.,Claim
10558,Let us take hospitals.,None
10581,We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.,Claim
10675,The same is true of highways.,Claim
10705,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.,None
10758,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen percent over seven years.,Premise
11093,That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.,Claim
11182,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.,None
11255,What has happened to you?,None
11281,We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.,Premise
11412,What about the prices you pay?,None
11443,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,Premise
11577,What's the net result of this?,None
11608,This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two percent in the Truman years.,Premise
11743,"Now, this is not standing still.",Claim
11776,"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.",None
11838,A record is never something to stand on.,None
11879,It's something to build on.,None
11907,"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",Claim
12016,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.",Claim
12087,Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.,None
12152,I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.,None
12220,"But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.",Premise
12324,They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.,Premise
12420,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.",None
12592,What kind of programs are we for?,None
12626,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",None
12836,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.",None
12997,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",None
13091,We both want to help the old people.,Claim
13128,We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.,Claim
13184,The question is the means.,None
13211,I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.,Claim
13312,"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",Premise
13654,"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.",None
13819,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.,None
13975,I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.,None
14025,It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.,None
14214,Now the Republican platform will cost more too.,Premise
14262,"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.",Premise
14414,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",None
14472,Not at all.,None
14484,Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.,None
14610,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,None
14673,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",Claim
14806,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",Claim
15054,"The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",None
15239,Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,None
15321,I know what it means to be poor.,Claim
15354,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,Claim
15409,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",Claim
15588,"Thank you, Mr. Nixon.",None
15610,"That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one another's answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks.",None
15785,The correspondents:,None
15962,The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Fleming.,None
16027,"Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature.",Premise
16123,He has raised the question of leadership.,None
16165,"On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?",None
16265,"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.",Premise
16371,"I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.",Premise
16505,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",Claim
16623,"I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.",Premise
16829,Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.,Premise
16874,He was nominated by it.,Premise
16898,"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.",Claim
17132,I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.,Claim
17187,I hope he would grant me the same.,Claim
17222,The question before us is:which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?,None
17329,"Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?",None
17392,I have no comment.,None
17418,The next question: Mr. Novins.,None
17457,"Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy-making.",Premise
17671,Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?,None
17821,It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.,None
17905,I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,None
17962,"First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.",Premise
18052,"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",Premise
18276,"After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.",Premise
18555,"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.",Premise
18847,"Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.",Premise
19108,I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.,None
19235,I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.,None
19443,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",Claim
19661,"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.",Premise
20009,I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.,Claim
20174,In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.,Claim
20391,"In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.",Claim
20631,I think it's true of Latin America also.,Claim
20672,"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",Premise
20944,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.,None
21006,"Uh - Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.",None
21110,That's correct.,None
21134,"I'd like to ask this: It's a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers.",Claim
21247,"Lots of people, I think, don't understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter.",Claim
21408,"Now, let me ask, sir, why can't the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory?",Claim
21505,If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn't step in and buy up the surplus.,Premise
21607,Why this constant courting of the farmer?,None
21658,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",Premise
21825,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,Premise
21883,There are hundreds of thousands of them.,Premise
21924,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,Premise
21996,"They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",Premise
22079,They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,Claim
22280,I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.,Claim
22373,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",Claim
22497,The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,Premise
22585,The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.,Premise
22645,"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",Premise
22799,So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,Claim
22866,"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",Claim
23000,"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",Premise
23151,We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,Premise
23282,I think that this farm policy has failed.,Claim
23324,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.,Claim
23428,And that can only be done through governmental action.,Premise
23483,"I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",Claim
23833,I think Mr.Benson's program has failed.,Claim
23873,"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",Claim
24033,I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,Claim
24092,"I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.",Claim
24212,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,Claim
24342,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",None
24369,I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.,Claim
24499,"He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.",Premise
24790,I think this is the wrong direction.,Claim
24827,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,Claim
24913,The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.,None
25023,It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.,Premise
25174,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,Claim
25271,The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.,Premise
25379,"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",Premise
25530,"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",Claim
25677,"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",Claim
25926,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.,None
25995,"Uh - Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, I'd like to follow Mr. Novins' question.",Claim
26140,"Now, Republican campaign slogans - you'll see them on signs around the country as you did last week - say it's experience that counts - that's over a picture of yourself; sir uh - implying that you've had more governmental executive decision-making uh - experience than uh - your opponent.",Claim
26430,"Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted.",None
26576,"His reply was, and I'm quoting; ""If you give me a week I might think of one.",None
26653,"I don't remember.""",None
26672,"Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasn't brought it up since, and I'm wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct - the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?",None
26917,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.",None
27028,"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",Claim
27349,The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.,Premise
27580,"Now, I can only say this.",None
27606,Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.,Premise
27669,I have been in the cabinet.,Premise
27697,I have met with the legislative leaders.,Premise

27858,The President has asked for my advice.,Premise
27897,I have given it.,None
27914,Sometimes my advice has been taken.,Premise
27950,Sometimes it has not.,None
27972,I do not say that I have made the decisions.,Premise
28017,"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",None
28151,All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.,None
28216,"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",None
28319,Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.,Claim
28450,"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.",None
28511,His experience has been different from mine.,None
28556,Mine has been in the executive branch.,Premise
28595,His has been in the legislative branch.,Premise
28635,I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,Claim
28803,Senator Kennedy.,None
28829,"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",Premise
29047,Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.,None
29257,There's no certain road to the presidency.,Claim
29300,There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.,Claim
29412,I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.,Premise
29460,I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.,Premise
29605,"I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",Premise
29796,The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,None
29937,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.,None
29999,"Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt.",Premise
30312,"And I'm wondering how you, if you're president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this.",Claim
30416,Does this mean that you?,None
30450,I didn't indicate.,None
30469,"I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.",Claim
30642,"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",Claim
30739,"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",Premise
30884,"Senator, I believe in - in one of your speeches -",None
30943,"No, never.",None
30962,- you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward -,None
31039,No.,None
31039,No.,None
31047,Not reducing the interest -,None
31083,- a reduction of the Federal debt.,None
31127,- reducing the interest rate.,Premise
31157,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",Claim
31462,"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",Premise
31583,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",Claim
31645,The Vice President and I disagree on this.,Premise
31688,"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.",Premise
31888,"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.",Claim
32129,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.",None
32214,I think that's a good investment.,Claim
32248,I think we're going to have to do it.,Claim
32286,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",Premise
32563,There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.,Premise
32663,"On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.",None
32906,I believe in the balanced budget.,Premise
32940,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,Premise
33078,"Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.",Claim
33282,"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",None
33415,"Mr. Nixon, your comment?",None
33447,Yes.,Claim
33452,"I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.",Claim
33610,"I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.",None
33810,As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.,Premise
33867,As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.,Claim
34036,"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.",Premise
34103,He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.,Premise
34202,"Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.",Claim
34553,"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",Claim
34732,"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",Claim
34910,"As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.",Premise
35094,I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.,None
35268,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.,Claim
35335,"Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education.",Premise
35527,"Mr. Vice President, you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace.",Premise
35661,"Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster.",Premise
35793,"And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers.",None
35957,"I wonder if you could explain that, sir.",None
36006,I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,Claim
36158,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",None
36567,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",None
36664,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?,None
36713,Why do I take it now?,None
36735,"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",Claim
36828,We need higher teachers' salaries.,Claim
36863,But we also want our education to be free of federal control.,Claim
36925,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",Claim
37094,I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,None
37190,There is another point that should be made.,None
37234,I favor higher salaries for teachers.,Premise
37272,"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",Claim
37592,"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.",Claim
37828,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",Premise
37947,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,None
38097,This is not enough; it should be more.,Claim
38136,But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,Premise
38269,My objection here is not the cost in dollars.,Premise
38315,"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",None
38529,Senator Kennedy's comment?,Claim
38565,"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",Premise
38761,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,Premise
38837,The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.,Claim
38946,On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.,Premise
38999,"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",Claim
39313,I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.,Premise
39385,"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",Claim
39623,And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.,Premise
39737,"Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",Premise
39895,"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",Claim
40095,That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,Claim
40177,My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,Premise
40322,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.,Claim
40386,"Senator, you've been promising the voters that if you are elected president you'll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education.",None
40601,"Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills.",None
40843,Now how do you feel that you'll be able to get them in January -,None
40918,Well as you take the bills -,None
40956,- if you weren't able to get them in August?,Premise
41010,"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.",Premise
41124,It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,Premise
41206,And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.,Claim
41430,We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.,Premise
41621,All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.,Premise
41734,"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",Claim
41801,It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,None
41865,It was killed in the Rules Committee.,Premise
41903,And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,None
42110,Four Democrats voted for it.,Premise
42139,Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.,None
42276,"Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.",None
42401,We wanted to tie it to Social Security.,Claim
42441,We offered an amendment to do so.,Premise
42475,"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",Premise
42539,And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,Claim
42663,"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",Claim
42810,"But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",None
43044,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",None
43071,Well obviously my views are a little different.,Claim
43119,"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",Premise
43305,"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",Claim
43466,It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.,Claim
43632,I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.,Premise
43810,"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",None
43932,Because let's consider it.,Premise
43959,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,Claim
44191,The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,Claim
44387,It was because they were too extreme.,Premise
44425,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",Claim
44763,The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.,None
44836,"Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate?",Claim
45054,"I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",Premise
45158,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",None
45253,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",Claim
45295,"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",None
45482,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,None
45649,It isn't really that.,Premise
45671,"Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.",Claim
45765,"And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",None
46114,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",Claim
46279,You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,Premise
46378,"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",None
46644,Senator Kennedy.,None
46670,"Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.",Premise
46757,One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.,Premise
46898,I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,None
47058,Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.,Claim
47106,"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.",Premise
47229,"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",Claim
47347,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",Claim
47595,I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,None
47665,But I do say a majority are.,Claim
47694,And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.,None
47753,"The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.",None
47874,It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.,Premise
47917,"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.",None
48143,So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,Claim
48197,I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,None
48254,One party is ready to move in these programs.,Claim
48300,The other party gives them lip service.,Claim
48348,Mr. Warren's question for Senator Kennedy.,None
48400,"Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States.",None
48551,"Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?",None
48702,"Well, I think they're serious.",Claim
48733,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.,Claim
48826,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.,Claim
48966,"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.",Premise
49082,"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.",Claim
49216,The major threat is external and will continue.,Claim
49271,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",Claim
49298,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.,Premise
49366,The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.,Premise
49463,It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.,Premise
49527,"We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.",None
49702,That's why we have to continue to be alert.,Claim
49746,It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.,Premise
49889,We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.,Claim
49955,"And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.",Claim
50351,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",None
50640,The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.,None
50732,Mr. Vanocur's question for Vice President Nixon.,None
50790,"Mr. Vice President uh - in one of your earlier statements you said we've moved ahead, we've built more schools, we've built more hospitals.",None
50930,"Now, sir, isn't it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing?",None
51021,"Uh - Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?",None
51194,Not at all.,None
51206,As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.,None
51288,Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.,None
51402,Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.,None
51452,"The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.",None
51640,We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.,None
51732,Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.,None
51839,"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",Premise
51912,"Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.",None
52327,And that is growth.,Claim
52347,That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.,None
52493,Senator Kennedy.,Claim
52519,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",None
52798,"Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.",Claim
52845,And I think we have a powerful country.,Claim
52885,"I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.",None
53141,The Soviet Union is making great gains.,None
53181,"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",Claim
53312,"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",Claim
53506,"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.",None
53607,Can I have the summation time please?,None
53645,"We've completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, we'll have the summation time.",None
53753,This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate.,None
53846,Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate.,None
53899,"Vice President Nixon, will you make the first summation?",None
53963,"Thank you, Mr. Smith.",None
53985,Senator Kennedy.,Claim
54002,"First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.",None
54146,The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.,Claim
54200,But the reason for that is obvious.,None
54236,They start from a much lower base.,Premise
54271,"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",None
54466,That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.,Claim
54523,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",None
54651,Is this any reason for complacency?,None
54687,Not at all Because these are determined men.,None
54732,They are fanatical men.,Premise
54756,And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.,Premise
54826,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,Claim
54881,Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.,Premise
54969,"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",Claim
55133,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.",None
55469,There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.,None
55550,The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.,Premise
55602,"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.",Premise
55830,It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.,None
55911,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.,Premise
55973,"His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.",Premise
56121,And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.,None
56214,Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,Claim
56291,The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.,Premise
56609,We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.,Premise
56780,It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.,None
56900,And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.,Premise
56961,But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.,None
57080,"Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.",None
57123,The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.,Claim
57218,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.,None
57323,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.,Claim
57379,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",None
57600,"Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.",None
57666,Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.,Premise
57713,The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.,None
57793,I think it's a very clear contrast.,Premise
57829,"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.",None
57941,Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.,Premise
57978,"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.",Claim
58134,"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",None
58309,The means are at question.,None
58336,The means are at issue.,Premise
58360,"If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",None
58747,I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.,Claim
58786,"But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.",Claim
59137,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?",None
59333,That's the great issue.,None
59357,And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.,Premise
59423,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.",Claim
59621,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",Claim
59744,I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.,None
59874,"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",None
60032,I think we're ready to move.,Claim
60061,"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",None
60151,"Thank you very much, gentlemen.",None
60183,This hour has gone by all too quickly.,None
60222,Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program.,None
60335,I've been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance.,None
60489,Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects.,None
60577,This is Howard K. Smith.,None
60602,Good night from Chicago.,
