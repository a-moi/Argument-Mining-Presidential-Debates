956,"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon.",None
978,"In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.",None
1098,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.",Premise
1375,"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.",Claim
1538,"We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.",Claim
1717,"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.",Premise
1870,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.,Premise
1929,But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.,Premise
2037,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",Claim
2183,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",None
2308,"If we fail, then freedom fails.",None
2340,"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?",Claim
2438,Are we as strong as we should be?,None
2472,"Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?",None
2693,"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",Claim
2837,"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.",Claim
2986,I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.,Claim
3061,I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.,Claim
3201,Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.,Premise
3351,"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.",Premise

4128,I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.,Claim
4246,I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.,Claim
4354,"Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.",Premise
4671,"These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.",None
4790,I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.,Claim
4868,If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.,Premise
5051,He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.,Premise
5126,"He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.",Premise

5357,I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.,Claim
5414,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.,None
5494,I don't at all.,Claim
5510,I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.,Claim
5565,And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.,Claim
5619,But I think there is also a national responsibility.,Claim
5672,The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.,None
5772,The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.,None
5894,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",None
6143,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.",None
6394,"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.",Claim
6477,And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.,Claim
6566,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.,None
6616,I think we can do a better job.,Claim
6648,I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.,Premise
6783,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,None
6827,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.",None
6894,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.,Claim
6970,The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.,None
7094,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.,Premise
7156,I want us to recapture that image.,Claim
7191,"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.",Claim
7427,That is the obligation upon our generation.,Claim
7471,"In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.",Premise
7586,I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.,Claim
7647,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?,Premise
7749,I think it can be.,Claim
7768,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,Claim
7835,I think it's time America started moving again.,Claim
7890,And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.,None
7963,"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy.",None
7991,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.,None
8059,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.,Claim
8236,"There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.",Premise
8413,"We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.",Claim
8488,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.",None
8560,"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",Claim
8698,"Where, then, do we disagree?",None
8727,I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.,Claim
8928,"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.",Premise
9078,"Now last year, of course, was 1958.",None
9114,That happened to be a recession year.,None
9152,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.,Premise
9193,"this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.",Claim
9314,More about that later.,None
9337,"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",Claim
9546,Is the United States standing still?,None
9583,"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",Premise
9717,"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",Premise
9878,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make.",None
9923,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.,None
10062,"When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",Premise
10211,Let's take schools.,None
10231,"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.",Claim
10389,Let's take hydroelectric power.,None
10421,We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.,Claim
10558,Let us take hospitals.,None
10581,We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.,Claim
10675,The same is true of highways.,Claim
10705,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.,None
10758,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen percent over seven years.,Premise
11093,That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.,Claim
11182,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.,None
11255,What has happened to you?,None
11281,We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.,Premise
11412,What about the prices you pay?,None
11443,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,Premise
11577,What's the net result of this?,None
11608,This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two percent in the Truman years.,Premise
11743,"Now, this is not standing still.",Claim
11776,"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.",None
11838,A record is never something to stand on.,None
11879,It's something to build on.,None
11907,"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",Claim
12016,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.",Claim
12087,Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.,None
12152,I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.,None
12220,"But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.",Premise
12324,They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.,Premise
12420,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.",None
12592,What kind of programs are we for?,None
12626,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",None
12836,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.",None
12997,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",None
13091,We both want to help the old people.,Claim
13128,We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.,Claim
13184,The question is the means.,None
13211,I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.,Claim
13312,"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",Premise
13654,"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.",None
13819,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.,None
13975,I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.,None
14025,It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.,None
14214,Now the Republican platform will cost more too.,Premise
14262,"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.",Premise
14414,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",None
14472,Not at all.,None
14484,Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.,None
14610,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,None
14673,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",Claim
14806,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",Claim
15054,"The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",None
15239,Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,None
15321,I know what it means to be poor.,Claim
15354,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,Claim
15409,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",Claim
15588,"Thank you, Mr. Nixon.",None
15610,"That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one another's answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks.",None
15785,The correspondents:,None
15962,The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Fleming.,None
16027,"Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature.",Premise
16123,He has raised the question of leadership.,None
16165,"On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?",None
16265,"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.",Premise
16371,"I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.",Premise
16505,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",Claim
16623,"I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.",Premise
16829,Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.,Premise
16874,He was nominated by it.,Premise
16898,"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.",Claim
17132,I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.,Claim
17187,I hope he would grant me the same.,Claim
17222,The question before us is:which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?,None
17329,"Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?",None
17392,I have no comment.,None
17418,The next question: Mr. Novins.,None
17457,"Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy-making.",Premise
17671,Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?,None
17821,It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.,None
17905,I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,None
17962,"First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.",Premise
18052,"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",Premise
18276,"After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.",Premise
18555,"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.",Premise
18847,"Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.",Premise
19108,I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.,None
19235,I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.,None
19443,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",Claim
19661,"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.",Premise
20009,I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.,Claim
20174,In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.,Claim
20391,"In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.",Claim
20631,I think it's true of Latin America also.,Claim
20672,"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",Premise
20944,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.,None
21006,"Uh - Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.",None
21110,That's correct.,None
21134,"I'd like to ask this: It's a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers.",Claim
21247,"Lots of people, I think, don't understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter.",Claim
21408,"Now, let me ask, sir, why can't the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory?",Claim
21505,If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn't step in and buy up the surplus.,Premise
21607,Why this constant courting of the farmer?,None
21658,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",Premise
21825,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,Premise
21883,There are hundreds of thousands of them.,Premise
21924,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,Premise
21996,"They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",Premise
22079,They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,Claim
22280,I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.,Claim
22373,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",Claim
22497,The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,Premise
22585,The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.,Premise
22645,"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",Premise
22799,So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,Claim
22866,"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",Claim
23000,"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",Premise
23151,We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,Premise
23282,I think that this farm policy has failed.,Claim
23324,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.,Claim
23428,And that can only be done through governmental action.,Premise
23483,"I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",Claim
23833,I think Mr.Benson's program has failed.,Claim
23873,"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",Claim
24033,I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,Claim
24092,"I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.",Claim
24212,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,Claim
24342,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",None
24369,I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.,Claim
24499,"He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.",Premise
24790,I think this is the wrong direction.,Claim
24827,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,Claim
24913,The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.,None
25023,It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.,Premise
25174,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,Claim
25271,The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.,Premise
25379,"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",Premise
25530,"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",Claim
25677,"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",Claim
25926,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.,None
25995,"Uh - Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, I'd like to follow Mr. Novins' question.",Claim
26140,"Now, Republican campaign slogans - you'll see them on signs around the country as you did last week - say it's experience that counts - that's over a picture of yourself; sir uh - implying that you've had more governmental executive decision-making uh - experience than uh - your opponent.",Claim
26430,"Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted.",None
26576,"His reply was, and I'm quoting; ""If you give me a week I might think of one.",None
26653,"I don't remember.""",None
26672,"Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasn't brought it up since, and I'm wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct - the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?",None
26917,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.",None
27028,"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",Claim
27349,The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.,Premise
27580,"Now, I can only say this.",None
27606,Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.,Premise
27669,I have been in the cabinet.,Premise
27697,I have met with the legislative leaders.,Premise

27858,The President has asked for my advice.,Premise
27897,I have given it.,None
27914,Sometimes my advice has been taken.,Premise
27950,Sometimes it has not.,None
27972,I do not say that I have made the decisions.,Premise
28017,"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",None
28151,All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.,None
28216,"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",None
28319,Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.,Claim
28450,"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.",None
28511,His experience has been different from mine.,None
28556,Mine has been in the executive branch.,Premise
28595,His has been in the legislative branch.,Premise
28635,I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,Claim
28803,Senator Kennedy.,None
28829,"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",Premise
29047,Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.,None
29257,There's no certain road to the presidency.,Claim
29300,There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.,Claim
29412,I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.,Premise
29460,I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.,Premise
29605,"I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",Premise
29796,The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,None
29937,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.,None
29999,"Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt.",Premise
30312,"And I'm wondering how you, if you're president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this.",Claim
30416,Does this mean that you?,None
30450,I didn't indicate.,None
30469,"I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.",Claim
30642,"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",Claim
30739,"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",Premise
30884,"Senator, I believe in - in one of your speeches -",None
30943,"No, never.",None
30962,- you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward -,None
31039,No.,None
31039,No.,None
31047,Not reducing the interest -,None
31083,- a reduction of the Federal debt.,None
31127,- reducing the interest rate.,Premise
31157,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",Claim
31462,"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",Premise
31583,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",Claim
31645,The Vice President and I disagree on this.,Premise
31688,"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.",Premise
31888,"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.",Claim
32129,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.",None
32214,I think that's a good investment.,Claim
32248,I think we're going to have to do it.,Claim
32286,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",Premise
32563,There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.,Premise
32663,"On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.",None
32906,I believe in the balanced budget.,Premise
32940,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,Premise
33078,"Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.",Claim
33282,"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",None
33415,"Mr. Nixon, your comment?",None
33447,Yes.,Claim
33452,"I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.",Claim
33610,"I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.",None
33810,As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.,Premise
33867,As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.,Claim
34036,"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.",Premise
34103,He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.,Premise
34202,"Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.",Claim
34553,"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",Claim
34732,"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",Claim
34910,"As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.",Premise
35094,I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.,None
35268,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.,Claim
35335,"Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education.",Premise
35527,"Mr. Vice President, you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace.",Premise
35661,"Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster.",Premise
35793,"And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers.",None
35957,"I wonder if you could explain that, sir.",None
36006,I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,Claim
36158,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",None
36567,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",None
36664,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?,None
36713,Why do I take it now?,None
36735,"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",Claim
36828,We need higher teachers' salaries.,Claim
36863,But we also want our education to be free of federal control.,Claim
36925,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",Claim
37094,I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,None
37190,There is another point that should be made.,None
37234,I favor higher salaries for teachers.,Premise
37272,"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",Claim
37592,"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.",Claim
37828,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",Premise
37947,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,None
38097,This is not enough; it should be more.,Claim
38136,But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,Premise
38269,My objection here is not the cost in dollars.,Premise
38315,"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",None
38529,Senator Kennedy's comment?,Claim
38565,"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",Premise
38761,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,Premise
38837,The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.,Claim
38946,On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.,Premise
38999,"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",Claim
39313,I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.,Premise
39385,"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",Claim
39623,And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.,Premise
39737,"Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",Premise
39895,"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",Claim
40095,That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,Claim
40177,My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,Premise
40322,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.,Claim
40386,"Senator, you've been promising the voters that if you are elected president you'll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education.",None
40601,"Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills.",None
40843,Now how do you feel that you'll be able to get them in January -,None
40918,Well as you take the bills -,None
40956,- if you weren't able to get them in August?,Premise
41010,"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.",Premise
41124,It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,Premise
41206,And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.,Claim
41430,We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.,Premise
41621,All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.,Premise
41734,"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",Claim
41801,It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,None
41865,It was killed in the Rules Committee.,Premise
41903,And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,None
42110,Four Democrats voted for it.,Premise
42139,Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.,None
42276,"Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.",None
42401,We wanted to tie it to Social Security.,Claim
42441,We offered an amendment to do so.,Premise
42475,"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",Premise
42539,And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,Claim
42663,"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",Claim
42810,"But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",None
43044,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",None
43071,Well obviously my views are a little different.,Claim
43119,"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",Premise
43305,"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",Claim
43466,It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.,Claim
43632,I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.,Premise
43810,"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",None
43932,Because let's consider it.,Premise
43959,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,Claim
44191,The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,Claim
44387,It was because they were too extreme.,Premise
44425,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",Claim
44763,The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.,None
44836,"Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate?",Claim
45054,"I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",Premise
45158,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",None
45253,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",Claim
45295,"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",None
45482,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,None
45649,It isn't really that.,Premise
45671,"Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.",Claim
45765,"And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",None
46114,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",Claim
46279,You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,Premise
46378,"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",None
46644,Senator Kennedy.,None
46670,"Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.",Premise
46757,One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.,Premise
46898,I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,None
47058,Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.,Claim
47106,"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.",Premise
47229,"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",Claim
47347,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",Claim
47595,I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,None
47665,But I do say a majority are.,Claim
47694,And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.,None
47753,"The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.",None
47874,It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.,Premise
47917,"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.",None
48143,So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,Claim
48197,I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,None
48254,One party is ready to move in these programs.,Claim
48300,The other party gives them lip service.,Claim
48348,Mr. Warren's question for Senator Kennedy.,None
48400,"Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States.",None
48551,"Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?",None
48702,"Well, I think they're serious.",Claim
48733,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.,Claim
48826,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.,Claim
48966,"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.",Premise
49082,"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.",Claim
49216,The major threat is external and will continue.,Claim
49271,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",Claim
49298,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.,Premise
49366,The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.,Premise
49463,It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.,Premise
49527,"We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.",None
49702,That's why we have to continue to be alert.,Claim
49746,It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.,Premise
49889,We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.,Claim
49955,"And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.",Claim
50351,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",None
50640,The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.,None
50732,Mr. Vanocur's question for Vice President Nixon.,None
50790,"Mr. Vice President uh - in one of your earlier statements you said we've moved ahead, we've built more schools, we've built more hospitals.",None
50930,"Now, sir, isn't it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing?",None
51021,"Uh - Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?",None
51194,Not at all.,None
51206,As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.,None
51288,Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.,None
51402,Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.,None
51452,"The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.",None
51640,We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.,None
51732,Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.,None
51839,"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",Premise
51912,"Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.",None
52327,And that is growth.,Claim
52347,That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.,None
52493,Senator Kennedy.,Claim
52519,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",None
52798,"Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.",Claim
52845,And I think we have a powerful country.,Claim
52885,"I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.",None
53141,The Soviet Union is making great gains.,None
53181,"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",Claim
53312,"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",Claim
53506,"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.",None
53607,Can I have the summation time please?,None
53645,"We've completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, we'll have the summation time.",None
53753,This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate.,None
53846,Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate.,None
53899,"Vice President Nixon, will you make the first summation?",None
53963,"Thank you, Mr. Smith.",None
53985,Senator Kennedy.,Claim
54002,"First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.",None
54146,The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.,Claim
54200,But the reason for that is obvious.,None
54236,They start from a much lower base.,Premise
54271,"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",None
54466,That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.,Claim
54523,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",None
54651,Is this any reason for complacency?,None
54687,Not at all Because these are determined men.,None
54732,They are fanatical men.,Premise
54756,And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.,Premise
54826,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,Claim
54881,Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.,Premise
54969,"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",Claim
55133,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.",None
55469,There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.,None
55550,The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.,Premise
55602,"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.",Premise
55830,It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.,None
55911,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.,Premise
55973,"His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.",Premise
56121,And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.,None
56214,Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,Claim
56291,The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.,Premise
56609,We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.,Premise
56780,It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.,None
56900,And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.,Premise
56961,But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.,None
57080,"Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.",None
57123,The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.,Claim
57218,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.,None
57323,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.,Claim
57379,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",None
57600,"Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.",None
57666,Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.,Premise
57713,The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.,None
57793,I think it's a very clear contrast.,Premise
57829,"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.",None
57941,Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.,Premise
57978,"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.",Claim
58134,"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",None
58309,The means are at question.,None
58336,The means are at issue.,Premise
58360,"If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",None
58747,I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.,Claim
58786,"But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.",Claim
59137,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?",None
59333,That's the great issue.,None
59357,And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.,Premise
59423,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.",Claim
59621,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",Claim
59744,I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.,None
59874,"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",None
60032,I think we're ready to move.,Claim
60061,"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",None
60151,"Thank you very much, gentlemen.",None
60183,This hour has gone by all too quickly.,None
60222,Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program.,None
60335,I've been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance.,None
60489,Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects.,None
60577,This is Howard K. Smith.,None
60602,Good night from Chicago.,
7,Good evening.,None
21,"This is Frank McGee, NBC News in Washington.",None
66,This is the second in a series of programs unmatched in history.,None
131,Never have so many people seen the major candidates for president of the United States at the same time; and never until this series have Americans seen the candidates in face-to-face exchange.,None
325,Tonight the candidates have agreed to devote the full hour to answering questions on any issue of the campaign.,None
437,"And here tonight are: the Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy.",None
573,Now representatives of the candidates and of all the radio and television networks have agreed on these rules: neither candidate will make an opening statement or a closing summation; each will be questioned in turn; each will have an opportunity to comment upon the answer of the other; each reporter will ask only one question in turn.,None
911,He is free to ask any question he chooses.,None
954,Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked and only the clock will determine who will be asked the last question.,None
1078,These programs represent an unprecedented opportunity for the candidates to present their philosophies and programs directly to the people and for the people to compare these and the candidates.,None
1273,The four reporters on tonight's panel include a newspaperman and a wire service representative.,None
1369,These two were selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates.,None
1499,The broadcasting representatives were selected by their respective companies.,None
1577,"The reporters are: Paul Niven of CBS, Edward P. Morgan of ABC, Alvin Spivak of United Press International, and Harold R. Levy of Newsday.",None
1715,Now the first question is from Mr. Niven and is for Vice President Nixon.,None
1798,"Mr. Vice President, Senator Kennedy said last night that the Administration must take responsibility for the loss of Cuba.",None
1921,Would you compare the validity of that statement with the validity of your own statements in previous campaigns that the Truman Administration was responsible for the loss of China to the Communists?,None
2129,"Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.",Claim
2280,"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.",Claim
2676,Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.,None
2794,He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.,None
2874,"I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.",None
3054,"There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.",Premise
3148,Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.,Premise
3207,We think that's pretty good progress.,Claim
3245,Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.,Premise
3408,"Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.",Claim
3543,"As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.",Claim
3628,And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.,Claim
3853,For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.,None
3943,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.",None
3997,There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.,Claim
4064,There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.,Claim
4142,There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.,Claim
4307,"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.",Claim
4431,"Senator Kennedy, would you care to comment?",None
4485,In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.,Claim
4568,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.,Claim
4658,"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.",Premise
4960,"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.",Claim
5030,"What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.",Claim
5201,"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.",None
5480,"Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.",Claim
5689,"I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.",Claim
6102,"Mr. Morgan, with a question for Senator Kennedy.",None
6160,"Senator, last May, in Oregon, you discussed the possibilities of sending apologies or regrets to Khrushchev over the U-2 incident.",None
6291,Do you think now that that would have done any good?,None
6344,Did you think so then?,None
6377,"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.",Premise
6538,In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.,Claim
6678,"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident.",None
6817,The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.,Premise
6896,But they were not in accordance with international law.,Claim
6952,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.",Claim
7450,The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.,Claim
7666,We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.,Premise
7748,The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.,Premise
7827,The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.,Premise
7905,That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.,Claim
8090,"I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.",Claim
8266,It's not appeasement.,Claim
8288,It's not soft.,Claim
8303,I believe we should be stronger than we now are.,Claim
8352,I believe we should have a stronger military force.,Claim
8404,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.,Claim
8466,"But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.",Claim
8836,Mr. Vice President.,None
8864,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,None
8921,"First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.",Claim
9067,He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.,Claim
9175,"Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.",Claim
9226,The United States is a strong country.,None
9265,"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.",Claim
9327,"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.",Claim
9585,"Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.",Premise
9836,This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.,Claim
9899,We all remember Pearl Harbor.,None
9929,We lost three thousand American lives.,None
9968,We cannot afford an intelligence gap.,Claim
10006,And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.,Claim
10108,"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.",Claim
10280,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.,Claim
10508,Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
10570,"Mr. Vice President, you have accused Senator Kennedy of avoiding the civil rights issue when he has been in the South and he has accused you of the same thing.",None
10730,"With both North and South listening and watching, would you sum up uh - your own intentions in the field of civil rights if you become president.",None
10884,My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.,Claim
10977,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.,Claim
11044,"And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.",Premise
11307,"Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.",Claim
11556,"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.",Claim
11744,That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.,Premise
11897,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.",Claim
12000,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.",None
12104,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.,Premise
12279,I have talked to Negro mothers.,None
12311,I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.,Premise
12514,"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.",Claim
12567,"So, under the circumstances, what do we do?",Claim
12611,Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.,Claim
12783,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",None
12938,Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.,Claim
13113,"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.",Claim
13224,"I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.",Premise
13538,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.",Claim
13721,Senator Kennedy.,None
13748,"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?",Claim
13911,Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.,Claim
14014,"Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?",Claim
14074,"He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.",Premise
14198,"He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.",Claim
14368,"Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.",Claim
14513,These are the great questions: equality of education in school.,Claim
14577,"About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.",None
14690,Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.,None
14766,"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.",Claim
14867,What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?,Claim
14978,"Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.",Claim
15116,What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?,Claim
15205,Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.,Claim
15302,And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.,Claim
15376,Mr. Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.,None
15429,"Senator, on the same subject, in the past you have emphasized the president's responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil rights questions.",None
15591,What specifically might the next president do uh - in the event of an uh - an occurrence such as Little Rock or the lunch-counter sit-ins?,None
15730,From the standpoint of,None
15763,Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.,Claim
15852,"First, as a legislative leader.",Claim
15884,"And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.",Claim
16123,"Secondly, as an executive leader.",Claim
16157,There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.,Premise
16294,The right to vote is basic.,Claim
16322,I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.,Claim
16478,"Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.",Claim
16566,Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.,Claim
16712,And that's in all sections of the United States.,Premise
16761,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",Claim
16799,There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.,Claim
16879,We are in a very difficult time.,Claim
16912,We need all the talent we can get.,Claim
16947,We sit on a conspicuous stage.,None
16978,We are a goldfish bowl before the world.,Claim
17019,We have to practice what we preach.,Claim
17055,We set a very high standard for ourselves.,Premise
17098,The Communists do not.,Claim
17121,They set a low standard of materialism.,Premise
17161,"We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.",Premise
17409,I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.,Claim
17474,"Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.",Claim
17524,I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.,Claim
17705,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.,Claim
17783,But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.,Claim
17858,I would hope an incident like that would not happen.,Claim
17911,"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.",Claim
18222,Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.,None
18336,"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.""",Premise
18536,And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.,Claim
18632,Mr. Vice President.,None
18660,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",Claim
18814,But let's look at the performance.,None
18849,"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.",Claim
19008,Let me s- look also at what I did.,None
19043,I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.,Claim
19143,Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.,None
19210,And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.,Claim
19398,"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",Premise
19996,All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.,Claim
20067,What we need is action.,Claim
20091,"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",Claim
20291,Mr. Morgan with a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
20353,"Mr. Vice President, in your speeches you emphasize that the United States is doing basically well in the cold war.",None
20468,"Can you square that statement with a considerable mass of bipartisan reports and studies, including one prominently participated in by Governor Rockefeller, which almost unanimously conclude that we are not doing nearly so well as we should?",None
20718,"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",Claim
20816,"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",Claim
20981,"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.",Claim
21137,"First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.",None
21200,Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.,None
21265,"I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.",Claim
21538,"Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.",Claim
21607,"When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.",None
21660,We were on one side; they were on the other side.,None
21710,What happened?,None
21725,There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.,Premise
21788,Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.,Premise
21866,That's a test of prestige.,Claim
21893,"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.",Claim
22012,Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.,Claim
22062,In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.,Claim
22179,"It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.",Premise
22249,What do we need?,None
22266,What tools do we need to fight us?,Claim
22301,"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.",Claim
22486,Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.,None
22615,"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.",None
22791,They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.,Premise
22879,They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.,Premise
22934,"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.",Claim
23060,So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.,Claim
23271,It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.,Claim
23352,But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.,Claim
23425,Senator Kennedy.,None
23452,Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.,Claim
23613,Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.,Premise
23709,I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.,None
23808,The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.,None
23964,"Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.",None
24029,We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.,Claim
24164,"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",None
24274,Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.,Claim
24423,We have not maintained our position and our prestige.,Claim
24477,"A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.",None
24749,Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.,Claim
24852,"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",Premise
25377,Mr. Spivak with a question for Senator Kennedy.,None
25434,"Senator, uh - following this up, how would you go about increasing the prestige you say we're losing, and could the programs you've devised to do so be accomplished without absolutely wrecking our economy?",None
25650,Yes.,Claim
25655,We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.,Claim
25731,"The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.",Claim
25883,meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.,None
25939,"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.",Claim
26219,"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.",Claim
26488,"We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.",Claim
26685,"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.",Claim
26842,This permits them to maintain their self-respect.,Claim
26892,It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.,Claim
26996,And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.,Claim
27105,I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.,Claim
27151,"And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.",Claim
27215,"We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.",Claim
27354,"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.",Claim
27511,"And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.",Claim
27700,I think the United States can afford to do these things.,Claim
27757,I think that we could not afford not to do these things.,Claim
27814,This goes to our survival.,Claim
27841,"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",Claim
28072,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",Premise
28479,I believe we can do it.,Claim
28503,"If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",Claim
28606,Mr. Vice President.,None
28634,Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.,Premise
28723,This is important.,Claim
28742,"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.",Claim
28916,We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.,Claim
29071,"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",Claim
29343,We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.,Claim
29395,"We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.",Claim
29621,This we must get across to the world.,Claim
29659,"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.",Claim
29818,The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.,Claim
29973,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,Premise
30075,We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.,Claim
30159,We must stand for our ideals.,Claim
30197,Mr. Levy with a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
30248,"LEVY; Mr. Vice President, the Labor Department today added five more major industrial centers to the list of areas with substantial unemployment.",None
30394,"You said in New York this week that as president you would use the full powers of the government, if necessary, to combat unemployment.",None
30530,Specifically what measures would you advocate and at what point?,None
30604,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,Claim
30723,"Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.",Premise
30877,Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.,None
31111,On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.,Claim
31228,"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.",Claim
31332,I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.,Claim
31456,"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.",Claim
31541,"In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.",Claim
31761,It also exists among minority groups.,Claim
31799,"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.",Claim
31887,"That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.",Premise
32034,"Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.",Claim
32338,I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.,Claim
32403,"But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.",Claim
32667,This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.,Claim
32754,I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.,Claim
32907,So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.,Claim
33001,But I do not expect it to come.,Claim
33041,Senator Kennedy.,None
33068,Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.,Claim
33156,I'm very familiar with it.,Premise
33183,It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.,None
33282,I was the floor manager.,None
33307,"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.",Claim
33465,We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.,Premise
33593,Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,Claim
33737,Our bill was far more effective.,Claim
33770,The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.,Claim
33902,"Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.",Premise
33964,I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.,Claim
34119,"Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.",Claim
34247,Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.,Claim
34316,"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",Claim
34504,"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.",Claim
34677,One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.,Premise
34730,The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.,Premise
34843,Mr. Niven with a question for Senator Kennedy.,None
34898,"Senator, while the main theme of your campaign has been this decline of American power and prestige in the last eight years, you've hardly criticized President Eisenhower at all.",None
35077,And in a speech last weekend you said you had no quarrel with the President.,None
35154,Now isn't Mr. Eisenhower and not Mr. Nixon responsible for any such decline?,None
35241,Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.,None
35373,The question is what we're going to do in the future.,Claim
35427,I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.,Claim
35510,In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.,None
35577,I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.,Claim
35653,Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.,Claim
35716,Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.,Claim
35766,"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.",Premise
36002,I disagree.,Claim
36014,"And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.",Claim
36282,That's the great issue.,Claim
36306,President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.,Premise
36417,And that's the debate.,Claim
36440,That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,Claim
36594,"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.",Claim
36709,"Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.",Claim
36898,"If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.",Claim
37262,"In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.",Premise
37322,We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.,Claim
37444,Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.,Premise
37551,We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.,Claim
37621,Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.,Premise
37669,He's had experience in it.,Premise
37696,"And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.",Claim
38094,I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.,Claim
38158,Mr. Vice President.,None
38186,"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",Claim
38287,In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.,Premise
38434,I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.,None
38513,Let me make my position cl ear.,None
38545,I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.,Premise
38633,I'm proud of the record of this Administration.,Premise
38681,I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.,Claim
38767,Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.,Premise
38888,But what does he offer?,Claim
38912,He offers retreads of programs that failed.,Claim
38956,"I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.",Premise
39255,"And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.",Premise
39522,I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.,Claim
39639,I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.,Claim
39711,"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",Claim
39866,Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
39928,"Mr. Vice President, according to news dispatches Soviet Premier Khrushchev said today that Prime Minister Macmillan had assured him that there would be a summit conference next year after the presidential elections.",None
40144,"Have you given any cause for such assurance, and do you consider it desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next year if Mr. Khrushchev persists in the conditions he's laid down?",None
40358,"No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.",Premise
40418,It would not be appropriate for me to do so.,Claim
40463,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",Claim
40614,"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",None
40703,I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.,None
40827,"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.",None
41064,We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.,Claim
41153,"There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.",Claim
41226,He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.,Premise
41406,"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.",Claim
41722,"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.",Claim
41873,"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",Claim
42363,Senator Kennedy.,None
42390,I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.,Claim
42457,It - my view is the same as his.,None
42490,Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.,None
42543,"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",Claim
42745,"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",Claim
42931,"Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.",Premise
43100,It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.,Claim
43147,It's going to be a test of our strength.,Claim
43188,"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",Claim
43640,"On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.",Claim
43711,"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",Claim
43947,Mr. Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.,None
44000,"Senator, in your acceptance speech at Los Angeles, you said that your campaign would be based not on what you intend to offer the American people, but what you intend to ask of them.",None
44183,Since that time you have spelled out many of the things that you intend to do but you have made only vague reference to sacrifice and self-denial.,None
44330,"A year or so ago, I believe, you said that you would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if you considered it necessary.",None
44466,That's right.,None
44487,Is this what you have in mind?,None
44528,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.",Claim
44669,"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",Claim
44786,"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.",Claim
44985,I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.,Claim
45173,I'm talking about a national mood.,Premise
45208,I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.,Premise
45350,We don't know what the future's going to bring.,Claim
45398,But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.,Claim
45560,"Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.",Premise
45727,That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.,Claim
45839,"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",Claim
46078,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",Claim
46227,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,Claim
46342,We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.,Premise
46400,We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.,Claim
46517,"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",Claim
46817,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",Claim
47032,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.,Claim
47143,Mr. Vice President.,None
47171,Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.,Claim
47309,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.",Claim
47470,In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.,Claim
47520,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.,Claim
47573,I hope not.,Claim
47585,I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,Claim
47645,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.,Premise
47815,"Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.",Premise
47972,"I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.",Claim
48261,"The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.",Premise
48374,But it isn't going to be working that way.,Claim
48417,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.,Claim
48491,"After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.",Claim
48594,Mr. Niven with a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
48654,"Mr. Vice President, you said that while Mr. Khrushchev is here, Senator Kennedy should talk about what's right with this country as well as what's wrong with the country.",None
48825,"In the 1952 campaign when you were Republican candidate for Vice President, and we were eh - at war with the Communists, did you feel a similar responsibility to t- talk about what was right with the country?",None
49042,I did.,Claim
49049,"And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.",Claim
49228,What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.,Premise
49303,"Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.",None
49399,He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.,None
49469,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?,None
49547,"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.",Premise
49706,In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.,Claim
49881,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.",Claim
50086,"But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.",Claim
50160,I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.,Claim
50229,I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.,Claim
50321,I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.,Claim
50499,Now this just wasn't true.,Claim
50526,"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.",Premise
50711,"But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.",Premise
50887,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.",Claim
51029,"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.",Claim
51128,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.,Claim
51198,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.,Claim
51342,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.",Claim
51399,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.",Claim
51462,And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.,Claim
51582,Senator Kennedy.,None
51609,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.",None
51932,"Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.",None
52082,And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.,None
52146,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.,Premise
52237,You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.,Claim
52390,You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.,Claim
52574,I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.,Claim
52814,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.,Claim
52870,And we ought to try to meet the problem.,Claim
52911,"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.",Premise
53074,They're wholly inaccurate.,Claim
53101,I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.,Claim
53151,"Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.",Premise
53351,So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.,Claim
53498,Mr. Morgan with a question for Senator Kennedy.,None
53555,"Senator, Saturday on television you said that you had always thought that Quemoy and Matsu were unwise places to draw our defense line in the Far East.",None
53707,Would you comment further on that and also address to this question; couldn't a pullback from those islands be interpreted as appeasement?,None
53856,"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.",Premise
54010,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.,Claim
54056,"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.",None
54209,We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.,Claim
54290,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.,Claim
54360,But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.,Claim
54412,"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.",Premise
54518,"Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.",Premise
54650,General Ridgway has said the same thing.,Premise
54691,"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.",Claim
54831,"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.",Claim
54971,I believe that we should defend Formosa.,Claim
55012,We should come to its defense.,Claim
55043,"To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.",Premise
55164,"Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.",Claim
55244,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.,Claim
55434,It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.,Premise
55477,"But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.",Claim
55802,I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.,Claim
55855,I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.,Claim
55901,I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.,Claim
56045,But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.,Claim
56167,"And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.",Claim
56403,Mr. Vice President.,None
56431,I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.,Claim
56489,"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.",Premise
56602,Generals testified to that.,Premise
56630,"And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.",Premise
56831,I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.,Premise
56912,But it didn't mean that.,Claim
56937,We had to go in when they came in.,Claim
56972,"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.",Claim
57114,It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.,Claim
57185,It's the principle involved.,Claim
57214,These two islands are in the area of freedom.,Premise
57260,The Nationalists have these two islands.,Premise
57301,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.,Claim
57401,"If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.",Premise
57530,In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.,Claim
57628,I am against it.,Claim
57645,"I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.",Claim
57797,"Gentlemen, we have approximately four minutes remaining.",None
57854,May I ask you to make your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity.,None
57949,And Mr. Levy has a question for Vice President Nixon.,None
58010,"Mr. Vice President, you are urging voters to forget party labels and vote for the man.",None
58097,Senator Kennedy says that in doing this you are trying to run away from your party on such issues as housing and aid to education by advocating what he calls a me-too program.,None
58273,Why do you say that party labels are not important?,None
58332,"Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.",Claim
58421,"I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.",None
58569,Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.,None
58642,"The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.",None
58759,"Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.",Claim
59035,It's what we are.,Claim
59053,It's our whole lives.,Claim
59075,It's what we stand for.,Claim
59099,It's what we believe.,Claim
59121,"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican.""",Claim
59273,"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.""",Claim
59416,That isn't enough.,Claim
59435,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.,Claim
59512,Now that means the best leadership.,Claim
59548,"It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.",Premise
59592,But the people are the ones that determine it.,Claim
59639,The people have to make up their minds.,Claim
59679,"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.""",Claim
59850,"I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.",Claim
59920,"Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.",None
60140,"All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.",Claim
60275,"They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.",Premise
60366,This is what I deeply believe.,Claim
60397,I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.,Claim
60462,"I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.",Claim
60592,Senator Kennedy.,None
60619,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.",Claim
60749,Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.,Claim
60903,The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.,Claim
60965,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.,Claim
61043,"It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.",Premise
61192,"The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.",Premise
61277,They do stand for something.,Claim
61306,They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.,Claim
61404,That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.,Premise
61481,"And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.",Premise
8,Good evening.,None
22,I'm Bill Shadel of ABC News.,None
51,It's my privilege this evening to preside at this the third in the series of meetings on radio and television of the two major presidential candidates.,None
203,Now like the last meeting the subjects to be discussed will be suggested by questions from a panel of correspondents.,None
321,"Unlike the first two programs, however, the two candidates will not be sharing the same platform.",None

Kennedy; separated by three thousand miles in a Los Angeles studio, the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; now joined for tonight's discussion by a network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see and hear the other.",None
752,"Good evening, Senator Kennedy.",None
792,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel.",None
827,"And good evening to you, Vice President Nixon.",None
882,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel.",None
917,And now to meet the panel of correspondents.,None
962,"Frank McGee, NBC News; Charles Van Fremd, CBS News; Douglass Cater, Reporter magazine; Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune.",None
1091,"Now, as you've probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates.",None
1315,The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies.,None
1380,The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them.,None
1541,There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation.,None
1622,The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters.,None

1948,Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked.,None
2002,Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question.,None
2072,Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy.,None
2149,"Senator Kennedy, yesterday you used the words ""trigger-happy"" in referring to Vice President Richard Nixon's stand on defending the islands of Quemoy and Matsu.",Premise
2310,"Last week on a program like this one, you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in Berlin.",Claim
2433,So the question is: would you take military action to defend Berlin?,None
2512,"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.",Premise
2631,That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.,Premise
2779,I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.,Premise
2868,It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.,Premise
2966,And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.,Claim
3213,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.,Claim
3308,"Mr. Vice President, do you wish to comment?",None
3360,Yes.,Claim
3365,"As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.",Premise
3576,I resent that comment.,Claim
3599,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.",Premise
3733,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,None
3789,I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.,None
3868,There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.,None
3928,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.,None
4018,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,None
4132,We had a war when we came into power in 1953.,Premise
4178,We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.,Claim
4290,"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.",Premise
4344,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.",Claim
4675,The next question is by Mr.,None
4703,Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.,None
4747,"Mr. Vice President, a two-part question concerning the offshore islands in the Formosa Straits.",None
4843,"If you were president and the Chinese Communists tomorrow began an invasion of Quemoy and Matsu, would you launch the uh - United States into a war by sending the Seventh Fleet and other military forces to resist this aggression; and secondly, if the uh - regular conventional forces failed to halt such uh - such an invasion, would you authorize the use of nuclear weapons?",None
5226,Mr.,None
5230,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",None
5436,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.",Premise
6003,"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.",Claim
6209,"I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.",Premise
6514,This is the history of dealing with dictators.,Premise
6561,This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.,Premise
6629,We tried this with Hitler.,Premise
6656,It didn't work.,Premise
6672,"He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.",None
6824,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?,None
6865,They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.,Claim
6955,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.",Claim
7145,"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?",None
7227,"I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?",None
7494,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",Claim
7715,"Senator Kennedy, do you wish to comment?",None
7766,Yes.,Claim
7771,The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.,Premise
7923,"The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.",Premise
8027,"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.""",Premise
8321,"Now, that is the issue.",None
8345,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.,Claim
8400,I support it and the Pescadores Island.,Claim
8440,That is the present American position.,Claim
8479,The treaty does not include these two islands.,Premise
8526,Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.,Premise
8625,"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.",Claim
8850,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.",Premise
9138,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",Premise
9265,The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.,Premise
9351,They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.,Premise
9430,We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.,Premise
9550,"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",Claim
9664,Mr. Cater has the next question for Senator Kennedy.,None
9725,"Senator Kennedy, last week you said that before we should hold another summit conference, that it was important that the United States build its strength.",None
9880,Modern weapons take quite a long time to build.,None
9928,What sort of prolonged period do you envisage before there can be a summit conference?,None
10015,And do you think that there can be any new initiatives on the grounds of nuclear disarmament uh - nuclear control or weapons control d- uh - during this period?,None
10186,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.",Premise
10377,"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.",Claim
10491,"It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.",Claim
10563,"Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.",Premise
10990,"There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.",Claim
11177,This is extremely serious.,Premise
11204,There have been many wars in the history of mankind.,Premise
11257,"And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.",Premise
11419,"One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.",Claim
11625,"Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.",Premise
11801,"Now, we may not succeed.",Premise
11826,The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.,Premise
11882,We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.,None
11929,It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.,None
11980,"But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.",Claim
12307,These must be done.,Premise
12327,"If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.",Claim

14094,"And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.",Premise

14519,"Mr. Nixon, I would like to ask eh - one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question.",None
14618,Uh - it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle.,None
14779,I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was a mistake for Chiang Kai-shek to deploy troops to these islands.,None
14938,I would like to ask what has led you to take what appears to be a different position on this subject.,None
15048,"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.",None
15412,"There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.",Claim

16084,"So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.",None
16146,What do we do then?,None
16166,"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.",Claim

16751,"And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.",Premise
16873,The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.,Premise
16935,"And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.",Premise
17339,The road to war is always paved with good intentions.,Premise
17393,"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.",Claim

30971,"Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.",Claim
31234,"Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.",Premise
31312,"He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.",Premise

33325,"I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.",Claim
33382,I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.,Premise

33645,"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.",Claim
33995,One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.,Premise
34063,There might be others.,Premise
34086,"By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.",Claim

34758,This is a difficult and sensitive matter.,Premise
34800,"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",Premise
34891,"He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.",None

35683,"The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.",Premise
36018,"On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.",Claim
36237,"My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.",Premise
36484,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,Claim
36613,"Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.",Premise
36839,"I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.",Claim
36979,"Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.",Premise
37174,"Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.",None
37753,It is actuarially sound.,Claim
37778,"So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.",Claim
37986,"But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.",None

38763,"Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.",Premise
38931,But Social Security is a tax.,Premise
38961,The people pay it.,Premise
38980,It comes right out of your paycheck.,Premise
39017,This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.,Claim
39087,He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.,Premise
39196,"Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.",Claim
39470,And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.,Premise
39641,Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?,Premise
39712,I don't think we should have that kind of a program.,Claim
39765,Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.,Claim
39891,"Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.",Premise
39963,We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.,Claim
40084,"I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.",None
40185,"Next, Mr. Drummond's question for Vice President Nixon.",None
40252,Uh - Mr. Nixon uh - before the convention you and Governor Rockefeller said jointly that the nation's economic growth ought to be accelerated; and the Republican platform states that uh - the nation needs to quicken the pace of economic growth.,None
40497,"Uh - Is it fair, therefore, Mr. Vice President, to conclude that you feel that there has been insufficient economic growth during the past eight years; and if so, what would you do beyond uh - present Administration policies uh - to step it up?",Claim
40750,"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.",Claim
40827,"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.",Premise
41047,"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",Premise
41298,Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.,Premise
41457,"We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.",Claim
41632,"It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.",None
41707,"Now, what do we do about it?",Claim
41736,"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.",Claim
41933,So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.,Claim
42036,"In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.",Premise
42118,"I refer, for example, to distressed areas.",Claim
42161,We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.,Claim
42270,We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.,Claim
42403,"That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.",Premise
42677,"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.",Premise
42830,"Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.",None
42917,Let's get that straight.,Premise
42942,Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.,Premise
43063,He's been traveling in some other country.,Premise
43106,We have been moving.,Premise
43127,We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.,Premise
43192,"But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.",None
43434,Senator Kennedy.,None
43461,"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.",None
43601,That's untrue.,Claim
43616,The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.,Premise
43724,"Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.",Premise
43870,The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.,Claim
43974,"And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.",Claim
44084,But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.,Premise
44200,The Vice President suggested a number of things.,Premise
44249,He suggested that we aid distressed areas.,Premise
44292,The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.,Premise
44362,He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.,Claim
44409,But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.,Claim
44520,"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.",Premise
44658,This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.,Claim
44823,"And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.",Premise
44943,Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.,Premise
44984,The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.,Premise
45038,Many say four and a half per cent.,Premise
45073,The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.,Claim
45153,That's why we don't have full employment today.,None
45210,Mr. McGee has the next question for Senator Kennedy.,None
45271,"Uh - Senator Kennedy, a moment ago you mentioned tax loopholes.",None
45335,"Now your running mate, Senator Lyndon Johnson, is from Texas, an oil-producing state and one that many political leaders feel is in doubt in this election year.",None
45496,And reports from there say that oil men in Texas are seeking assurance from Senator Johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut.,None
45638,The Democratic platform pledges to plug holes in the tax laws and refers to inequitable depletion allowance as being conspicuous loopholes.,None
45778,"My question is, do you consider the twenty-seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable, and would you ask that it be cut?",Premise
45924,"Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.",Claim
46075,I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.,Claim
46257,That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.,Premise
46364,We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.,Claim
46408,It includes oil abroad.,Premise
46432,Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.,Premise
46513,Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.,Premise
46563,Particularly some of the smaller producers.,Premise
46607,They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.,Claim
46657,"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.",Premise
46769,"And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.",Claim
47053,"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",None
47289,Mr. Vice President.,Claim
47317,Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.,Claim
47383,I favor the present depletion allowance.,Premise
47424,"I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.",None
47526,Why do we have a depletion allowance?,Premise
47564,"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.",Claim
47671,"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.",Claim
47825,"Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.",Premise
47912,"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.",Premise
48200,And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.,None
48250,One other thing.,Premise
48267,He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.,Premise
48382,"He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.",Claim
48508,"I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.",Claim
48820,But I oppose it.,Claim
48837,I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.,Premise
48883,I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.,None
48965,"Gentlemen, if I may remind you, time is growing short, so please keep your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity.",None
49108,Mr.,None
49112,Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.,None
49156,"Mr. Vice President, in the past three years, there has been an exodus of more than four billion dollars of gold from the United States, apparently for two reasons: because exports have slumped and haven't covered imports, and because of increased American investments abroad.",None
49432,"If you were president, how would you go about stopping this departure of gold from our shores?",None
49535,"Well, Mr.",Claim
49545,"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",Premise
49651,"That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.",Claim
49886,"Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.",Claim
49959,And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.,Claim
50043,This one must be stepped up.,Premise
50072,"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",Premise
50345,Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.,Claim
50410,I think we have been right in carrying it.,Premise
50453,I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.,Premise
50541,"But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.",Premise
50738,They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.,Claim
50820,"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.",Claim
51113,The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.,Claim
51198,"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",None
51395,Senator Kennedy.,Premise
51422,"Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.",Premise
51525,What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.,Claim
51631,"If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.",None
51717,Now on the question of gold.,Premise
51746,"The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.",Claim
52009,"In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.",Claim
52149,"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.",Claim
52244,We have to be able to compete in the world market.,Claim
52295,We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.,Premise
52418,"In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.",Premise
52582,"Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.",Claim
52685,I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.,Claim
52888,We have to be sure to maintain that.,Claim
52925,"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.",None
53277,Mr. Drummond's question now for Senator Kennedy.,None
53337,"Senator Kennedy, a question on American prestige.",None
53387,"In light of the fact that the Soviet Ambassador was recently expelled from the Congo, and that Mr. Khrushchev has this week canceled his trip to Cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all Latin America, I would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure American prestige, to determine whether it is rising or whether it is falling.",Claim
53777,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.",Premise
53845,"And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.",Claim
53945,"Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.",Claim
54318,There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.,None
54403,"Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.",Premise
54587,He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.,Claim
54707,"And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.",Claim
54855,"Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.",Premise
54927,Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.,Claim
54999,"This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.",Premise
55144,"Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.",Claim
55300,"And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.",Claim
55395,"Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.",Claim
55722,Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.,Claim
55792,A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.,Claim
55870,"On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.",Claim
55961,"The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.",None
56159,There are many indications.,Claim
56187,"Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.",Claim
56414,Laos is moving in that direction.,Claim
56448,So I would say our prestige is not so high.,Premise
56492,No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.,Premise
56545,No longer do we give an image of vitality.,None
56597,Mr. Vice President.,Claim
56625,"Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.",Premise
56806,Let's look at the other side of the coin.,Premise
56848,"Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.",Premise
56943,Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.,Premise
57019,We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.,Claim
57078,Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.,Premise
57188,"We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.",Premise
57316,"We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.",None
57521,"And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.",Claim
57618,"I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.",Claim
57971,"In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.",Premise
58148,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.",Claim
58239,Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.,

1449,"For the first opening statement, here is Vice President Nixon.",None
1520,"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.",None
1568,Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.,Premise
1628,I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.,Premise
1769,"There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.",Claim
1947,"And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?",Claim
2047,How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?,None
2098,"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?",Claim
2236,Who threatens freedom in the world?,None
2272,There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.,Claim
2398,"And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.",Claim
2501,I know Mr. Khrushchev.,Premise
2524,I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.,Premise
2617,"I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.",Premise
2794,"First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.",Premise
2892,"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.",Premise
3040,And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.,Premise
3155,"In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.",Premise
3256,"We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.",Premise
3421,"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",None
3490,I think there're several reasons.,Claim
3524,"In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.",Premise
3706,One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.,Claim
3780,"In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.",Premise
3854,They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.,Premise
3915,We learned from their mistakes.,Claim
3947,"And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.",Premise
4094,We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.,Premise
4194,"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.",Premise
4301,"That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.",Claim
4479,"That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.",Claim
4905,Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?,None
5002,"Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.",Claim
5233,It encourages them to begin a war.,Claim
5268,"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.",Premise
5369,Let us move now to the future.,None
5400,"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.",Premise
5539,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",Claim
5634,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.",Premise
5989,"They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.",Claim
6073,We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.,Premise
6145,"In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.",Claim
6246,It has grown in the past seven years.,Premise
6284,It can and will grow even more in the next four.,Claim
6333,And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.,Premise
6550,We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.,Claim
6596,"And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.",Premise
6857,"And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.",Claim
6962,What are they?,None
6977,Again we turn to the past.,Premise
7004,"Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.",Premise
7104,"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.",Premise
7226,And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.,Premise
7305,But all this by itself is not enough.,Claim
7343,"It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.",Claim
7474,We must have a great goal.,Claim
7501,"And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.",Claim

17629,Our policies are very different.,None
17662,I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.,Claim
17884,"In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.",Premise
18083,Now let's just see what this means.,Premise
18119,"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.",Premise
18387,"The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.",Premise
18563,"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.",None
18705,"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.",Claim
18925,I know something else.,None
18948,"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.",Claim
19119,This is the major recommendation that he's made.,Premise
19168,"Now, what can we do?",None
19189,"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.",Claim
19233,There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.,Premise
19316,We quarantined Mr. Arbenz.,Premise
19343,The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.,Premise
19439,We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.,Premise
19477,"We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.",Claim
19701,We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.,Premise
19791,"By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.",Claim
19964,"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",Claim
20134,Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.,Claim
20179,"He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.",Premise
20380,"There isn't any doubt about that, number one.",Premise
20426,"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.",Claim
20558,They have to include the other countries of Latin America.,Claim
20617,"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.",Premise
20827,If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.,Premise
21033,"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.",Claim
21185,"Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.",Claim
21274,"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.",Premise
21400,"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.",Premise
21623,His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.,Premise
21769,His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,Premise
21858,"You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.",Premise
22032,Why didn't we?,None
22054,John Edwards has his first question for Senator Kennedy.,None
22121,"Senator Kennedy, one test of a new president's leadership will be the caliber of his appointments.",None

22310,"Now, under our rules, I must ask this question of you, but I would hope that the Vice President also would answer it.",None
22428,"Will you give us the names of three or four Americans, each of whom, if appointed, would serve with distinction in your judgment as secretary of state?",None
22590,"Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.",Claim
22795,This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.,Claim
22865,The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.,Premise
22966,This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.,Premise
23060,There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.,Premise
23124,I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.,Premise
23186,"I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.",Claim
23257,"The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.",Premise
23478,"The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.",Premise
23597,Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.,Premise
23703,"I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.",Premise
23946,I'm asking the people's support as president.,Premise
23992,We will select the best man we can get.,Claim
24032,"But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",Premise
24165,"Mr. Vice President, do you have a comment?",None
24216,"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.",Claim
24539,So that is my answer to this question.,None
24578,"If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.",None
24723,Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.,None
24815,"I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.",Premise
25346,"We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.",Premise
25538,Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.,Premise
25682,"Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.",Premise
25871,"Walter Cronkite, you have your first question for Vice President Nixon.",None
25954,Thank you Quincy.,None
25972,"Mr. Vice President, Senator Fulbright and now tonight, Senator Kennedy, maintain that the Administration is suppressing a report by the United States Information Agency that shows a decline in United States prestige overseas.",None
26198,"Are you aware of such a report, and if you are aware of the existence of such a report, should not that report, because of the great importance this issue has been given in this campaign, be released to the public?",None
26421,"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",Premise
26565,"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.",Claim
26649,"First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.",Premise
26820,"Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.",Premise
26916,"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.",Premise
27196,"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",Claim
28030,"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.",Claim
28090,Well let me make one thing clear.,None
28124,"Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.",Premise
28266,Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.,Claim
28343,And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.,Claim
28407,"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.",Premise
28531,Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.,Premise
28596,Let's look at the vote on Hungary.,Premise
28631,There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.,Premise
28737,Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.,Premise
28833,Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?,Premise
28930,Not at all.,None
28942,The President gained.,Premise
28964,"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",Claim
29180,"Comment, Senator Kennedy?",None
29216,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,Claim
29311,I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.,Premise
29403,"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.",Premise
29458,"What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.",Premise
29546,Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.,Claim
29609,The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.,Claim
29668,"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.",Premise
29918,I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.,Claim
29986,"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.",Claim
30046,I said we had too many slums.,Premise
30076,"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.",Premise
30223,I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.,Claim
30277,"What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.",Premise
30496,"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",Claim
30837,"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.",Premise
30992,"Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",Premise
31096,"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.",Claim
31246,"We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.",Claim
31348,"John Chancellor, your first question for Senator Kennedy.",None
31419,"Senator, another question uh - in connection with our relations with the Russians.",None
31502,There have been stories from Washington from the Atomic Energy Commission hinting that the Russians may have resumed the testing of nuclear devices.,Claim
31651,"Now if - sir, if this is true, should the United States resume nuclear testing, and if the Russians do not start testing, can you foresee any circumstances in 1961 in which the United States might resume its own series of tests?",None
31890,"Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.",Claim
32033,"I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.",Claim
32141,"If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.",Premise
32353,"Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.",Premise
32784,So one more effort should be made.,Claim
32819,I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.,Claim
32956,"They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.",Premise
33037,But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.,Claim
33141,"If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.",Claim
33222,I hope we can succeed.,None
33245,"But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.",Claim
33445,I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.,Claim
33501,There may be testing in outer space.,Claim
33538,I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.,Premise
33626,It's possible to detect those kind of tests.,Premise
33671,The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.,Premise
33768,So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.,Premise
33810,If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.,Claim
33874,But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.,Premise
33954,"China may have it by 1963, Egypt.",Premise
33988,"War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.",Premise
34183,We ought to make one last effort.,Claim
34224,"Any comment, Mr. Vice President?",None
34265,Yes.,None
34270,"I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.",Premise
34435,"As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.",Premise
34548,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.,Claim
34625,"I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.",Claim
34728,"I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.",Claim
35110,There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.,Claim
35183,"But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.",Claim
35318,I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.,Claim
35366,"I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.",Claim
35552,Our second round of questions begins with one from Mr. Edwards for the Vice President.,None
35649,"Mr. Nixon, carrying forward this business about a timetable; as you know, the pressures are increasing for a summit conference.",None
35777,"Now, both you and Senator Kennedy have said that there are certain conditions which must be met before you would meet with Khrushchev.",None
35912,Will you be more specific about these conditions?,None
35970,"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.",Premise
36106,"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",Claim
36187,This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.,Premise
36262,"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.",Premise
36411,Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.,Claim
36523,"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.",Claim
36730,"Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.",Premise
36783,But let's look at the other side of the coin.,Premise
36829,"If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.",Claim
37092,We do not help it.,Claim
37111,"We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",Premise
37219,"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",Claim
37388,"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.",Premise
37714,"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",Premise
37882,"Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.",None
37932,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",Premise
38086,"Any comments, Senator Kennedy?",None
38127,"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.",Premise
38347,He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.,Premise
38424,He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.,Premise
38527,"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",Premise
38619,"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.",Claim
38821,"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",Claim
38952,The Soviet Union does understand strength.,Premise
38995,"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.",Premise
39051,"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",Claim
39367,And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.,Claim
39449,"But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.",Claim
39547,"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.",Premise
39722,"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",Claim
39831,We have time for only one or two more questions before the closing statements.,None
39910,Now Walter Cronkite's question for Senator Kennedy.,None
39973,"Senator, the charge has been made frequently that the United States for many years has been on the defensive around the world, that our policy has been uh - one of reaction to the Soviet Union rather than positive action on our own.",None
40206,What areas do you see where the United States might take the offensive in a challenge to Communism over the next four to eight years?,None
40350,"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.",Claim
40450,"I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.",Premise
40695,We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.,Premise
40769,But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.,Premise
40939,I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.,Premise
41026,"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.",Premise
41140,We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.,Premise
41213,I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.,Claim
41305,"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.",Claim
41355,"They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.",Premise
41533,"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",Claim
41663,"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.",Premise
41754,"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.",Claim
41850,India started from about the same place that China did.,Premise
41906,Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.,Premise
41968,India under a free society has been making some progress.,Premise
42026,"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.",Claim
42325,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",Claim
42461,This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.,Premise
42521,It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.,Premise
42618,They want to be free.,Claim
42640,And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.,Claim
42727,"They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.",Claim
42823,"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.",Claim
43313,We can make it move.,Claim
43334,We can put the Communists on the defensive.,Claim
43385,"Your comment, Mr. Vice President?",None
43427,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.",Premise
43615,"Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.",Premise
43795,"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.",Premise
43965,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,Claim
44120,In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.,Premise
44362,"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",None
44475,I would just like to s- add this one point.,None
44519,"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.",Premise
44753,"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",Premise
45086,"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",Claim
45222,John Chancellor's question for Vice President Nixon.,None
45288,"Sir, I'd like to ask you an- another question about Quemoy and Matsu.",None
45358,Both you and Senator Kennedy say you agree with the President on this subject and with our treaty obligations.,None
45469,But the subject remains in the campaign as an issue.,None
45522,"Now is - sir, is this because each of you feels obliged to respond to the other when he talks about Quemoy and Matsu, and if that's true, do you think an end should be called to this discussion, or will it stay with us as a campaign issue?",None
45770,I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.,Claim
45916,He says he supports the President's position.,Premise
45962,He says that he voted for the resolution.,Premise
46004,Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,Premise
46191,"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",Premise
46446,"He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.",Premise
46506,He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.,Premise
46563,"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",Claim
46633,"Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.",Premise
46962,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",Claim
47398,I support the President's position.,Premise
47434,I have always opposed drawing a line.,Claim
47472,"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",Premise
47685,And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.,Premise
47765,"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.""",Claim
47867,"Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.",Premise
47936,"But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.",Premise
48100,It's very simple for him to clear it up.,Claim
48141,He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.,Premise
48266,"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.",Claim
48340,"Senator Kennedy, your comment.",None
48381,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",None
48418,"The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",Premise
48588,"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",Premise
48787,The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.,Premise
48855,"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",Premise
49073,"General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.",Premise
49159,"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.",Claim
49271,Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.,Premise
49323,Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.,Premise
49358,"Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.",Premise
49521,"And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.",Premise
49757,I support that.,Claim
49773,"In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.",Claim
49940,"That's not the position you took, however.",Claim
49983,"The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.",Premise
50150,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,Premise
50208,You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.,Premise
50353,And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.,None
50516,Under the agreed,None
50543,And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.,None

50977,I'm devoted to it.,Claim
50996,"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.",Claim
51087,"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",Claim
51311,"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.",Claim
51439,Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.,Premise

51985,"And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.",Claim
52029,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",Claim
52234,"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.",Premise
52435,Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.,Premise
52501,Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.,Premise

1787,"Governor, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you.",None
1952,"Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh - candidates in any year, is that many voters say they don't really know where you stand.",None
2100,"Now, you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment.",None
2225,"Can you say now, Governor, in specific terms, what your first step would be next January, if you are elected, to achieve that.",None
2361,Yes.,None
2366,First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.,None
2516,"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.",Claim
2759,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.",Claim
2893,There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.,Claim
2977,"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.",Premise
3088,"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.",Premise
3211,"Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.",Premise
3560,"Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.",Premise
3811,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.,Premise
4026,"Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.",Premise
4265,"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.",Claim
4395,"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.",Claim
4622,In a &gt; Transfer interrupted!,None
4654,"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.",Premise
4965,"But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",Premise
5325,"Governor, uh - in the event you are successful and you do achieve a drastic drop",None
5415,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",None
5593,Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.,Premise
5921,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",Claim
6085,I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.,Claim
6196,But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.,Premise
6390,"Mr. President, your response.",None
6427,I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.,Claim
6547,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,Premise
6704,"That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.",Premise
6942,"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.",Premise
7139,We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.,Premise
7361,"We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.",Claim
7661,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,Claim
7881,"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.",Claim
8045,"Mr. Gannon, your question to President Ford.",None
8099,"Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised.",None
8209,You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans - even those earning up to $30 thousand a year.,Premise
8328,That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue.,Claim
8406,"In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?",None
8608,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.",Premise
8780,"I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.",Premise
8976,"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.",Premise
9157,"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.",Premise
9359,"That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.",Premise
9588,"But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.",Claim
9736,"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",Premise
9887,For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.,Premise
9989,We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.,Premise
10046,And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.,Premise
10149,"With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.",Claim
10262,"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",Premise
10542,"Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh - the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh - sort of outline that you requested.",None
10717,"What is your intention on that bill, uh - since it doesn't meet your - your requirements?",None
10807,Do you plan to sign that bill?,None
10845,That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.,Claim
10915,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",Premise
11113,"And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.",Premise
11283,"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.",Premise
11458,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.,Premise
11569,"Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.",Premise
11698,It has some good provisions in it.,Premise
11733,"It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.",Premise
11799,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.",Premise
11961,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.",Claim
12100,"Governor Carter, your response.",None
12141,"Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.",Claim
12217,The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.,Claim
12316,"As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.",Premise
12546,"When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.",Premise
12817,"In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.",Premise
13026,"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.",Premise
13412,"The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.",Claim
13570,"As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.",Premise
13769,"We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.",Premise
13869,And this is what the Republicans have done to us.,Premise
13919,And this is why a tax reform is so important.,Claim
13974,"Mrs. Drew, your question to Governor Carter.",None
14026,"Uh Governor Carter, you proposed a number of new or enlarged programs, including jobs, health, welfare reform, child care, aid to education, aid to cities, changes in social security and housing subsidies.",Premise
14232,You've also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term.,Premise
14314,"Now you haven't put a price tag on those programs, but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term, and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period, there still isn't enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any - any estimates that I've been able to see.",Premise
14675,"So, in that case what would give?",None
14718,"Well, as a matter of fact there is.",Claim
14754,"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.",Premise
15502,Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.,Claim
15614,"I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.",Claim
15912,I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.,Claim
16000,And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.,Premise
16058,I stand behind them.,Claim
16079,"And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.",Claim
16216,"Governor, uh - according to the budget committees of the Congress tha- tha- tha- that you referred to, if we get to full employment - what they project at a 4 percent unemployment - and, as you say, even allowing for the inflation in the programs, there would not be anything more than a surplus of $5 billion by the end of ninet- by 1981.",Premise
16556,And conservative estimates of your programs would be that they'd be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars.,Premise
16663,So how - how do you say that you're going to be able to do these things and balance the budget?,None
16768,"Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",None
16895,"No, they took that into account in those figures.",None
16954,"I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.",Premise
17297,And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.,Premise
17391,"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.",Premise
17531,Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.,Claim
17671,The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.,Premise
17752,"And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.",Claim
17956,"And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.",Premise
18156,"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.",Claim
18262,Keep my promises to the American people.,Claim
18303,"And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",Claim
18531,President Ford.,None
18554,"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.",Premise
18888,I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.,Claim
19048,It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.,None
19121,"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.",Premise
19309,"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.",Premise
19490,"And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.",Premise
19737,"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",Premise
19900,I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.,Premise
19962,"We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",Premise
20126,Mr. Reynolds.,None
20151,"Mr. President, when you came into office you spoke very eloquently of the need for a time for healing, and very early in your administration you went out to Chicago and you announced, you proposed a program of uh case-by-case pardons for draft resisters to restore them to full citizenship.",None
20442,"Some fourteen thousand young men took advantage of your offer, but another ninety thousand did not.",None
20542,"In granting the pardon to former President Nixon, sir, part of your rationale was to put Watergate behind us to - if I may quote you again - truly end our long national nightmare.",None
20722,"Why does not the same rationale apply now, today, in our Bicentennial year, to the young men who resisted in Vietnam, and many of them still in exile abroad?",None
20887,The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.,Premise
21071,About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.,Premise
21142,We gave them ample time.,Premise
21167,I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.,Claim
21248,"Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.",Claim
21398,"There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.",Premise
21510,"Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.",Premise
21554,"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.",Premise
21813,Mr. Nixon resigned.,Premise
21833,That is disgrace.,Claim
21851,The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.,Premise
21945,"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",Premise
22425,"I take it then, sir, that you do not believe that uh - it is - that you are going to reconsider and uh - think about those ninety thousand who are still abroad.",None
22586,Uh - have they not been penalized enough - many of 'em been there for years?,None
22670,"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.",None
22772,I do not agree with that point of view.,Claim
22812,"I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.",Premise
23000,I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.,Claim
23099,Governor Carter.,None
23125,Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.,None
23322,As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.,Claim
23394,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.,Premise
23543,Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.,Premise
23607,"Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.",Premise
23692,And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.,Claim
23744,I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.,Premise
23960,"But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.",Claim
24218,"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.",Premise
24476,"And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.",Claim
24764,But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.,Claim
25047,Mr. Gannon.,None
25068,"Governor Carter, you have promised a sweeping overhaul of the federal government, including a reduction in the number of government agencies - you say it would go down about two hundred from some nineteen hundred.",None
25282,"That sounds, indeed, like a very deep cut in the federal government.",None
25351,"But isn't it a fact that you're not really talking about fewer federal employees or less government spending, but rather that you are talking about reshaping the federal government, not making it smaller?",None
25565,"Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.",Claim
25642,"When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.",Premise
25897,And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.,Premise
25975,We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.,Premise
26028,We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.,Premise
26143,It hasn't been undone since I was there.,Premise
26184,"It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.",Premise
26459,I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.,Claim
26515,"When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.",Claim
26717,We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.,Premise
26772,"When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.",Premise
26902,"That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.",Premise
27006,This needs to be changed.,Claim
27032,We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.,Claim
27097,We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.,Claim
27162,"For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.",Premise
27363,Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.,Premise
27421,The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.,Premise
27490,None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.,Premise
27546,This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.,Claim
27616,We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.,Premise
27716,Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.,Claim
27779,"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.",Premise
27978,"This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.",Claim
28232,"Well, I'd like to - to press my question on the number of federal employees - whether you would really plan to reduce the overall - uh number, or - or merely put them in different departments and relabel them.",None
28442,"Uh - in your energy plan, you consolidate a number of a - agencies into one, or you would, but uh does that really change the overall?",None
28586,I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.,Claim
28695,It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.,Premise
28773,"The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.",Premise
28910,"Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.",Premise

29573,"In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.",Premise
29659,"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.",Premise

30358,In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.,Premise
30439,This is the kind of change that would be made.,Claim
30486,"And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",Claim
30848,President Ford.,None
30871,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.",Premise

31610,"He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.",Premise
31746,Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.,Premise
32028,And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.,Premise
32143,"In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.",Premise
32250,"We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.",Claim
32432,"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",Claim
32618,Mrs. Drew.,None
32636,"Mr. President, at Vail, after the Republican convention, you announced that you would now emphasize five new areas; among those were jobs and housing and health and improved recreational facilities for Americans.",None

32875,You also mentioned education.,None
32905,For two years you've been telling us that we couldn't do very much in these areas because we couldn't afford it; and in fact we do have a $50 billion deficit now.,None
33068,"In rebuttal to Governor Carter a little bit earlier, you said that if there were to be any surplus in the next few years you thought it should be turned back to the people in the form of tax relief.",None

33393,"Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.",Claim
33476,"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.",Premise
33579,"But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.",Premise
33937,The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.,Claim

34069,We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.,Claim
34124,"We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.",Claim
34404,We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.,Premise
34514,But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.,Premise
34590,"We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.",Premise
34770,"We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.",Claim
34885,That doesn't cost any more money.,Premise

35040,We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.,Premise
35125,It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.,Premise
35298,At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.,Premise
35385,I don't know where that money would come from.,Premise
35432,"But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",Claim
35653,"Sir, in the next few years would you try to reduce the deficit, would you spend more money far these programs that you have just outlined, or would you, as you said earlier, return whatever surplus you got to the people in the form of tax relief?",None
35907,"We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.",Premise
36153,"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.",Claim

37084,Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.,Claim

38519,He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.,Premise
38597,"This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.",Premise
38945,"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",Premise
39273,The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.,Premise
39388,This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.,Claim

40738,I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.,Premise
40953,We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.,Claim
41017,The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.,Claim

41722,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.",Premise
41784,I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.,Claim
41844,We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.,Premise
41901,"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.",Claim
42065,"For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.",Premise

42311,"There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.",Claim
42511,"These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.",Claim
42620,"So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",Premise
42969,That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.,Claim
43059,"Well Governor, on that same subject, would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel?",None

43193,Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.,Claim

43417,We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.,Premise
43477,"We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.",Premise

44089,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.,Claim
44131,Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.,Claim
44207,And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.,Claim
44324,"One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.",Premise
44479,"And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.",Premise

44922,In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.,Claim
45070,It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.,Premise
45146,It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.,Premise
45234,If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.,Claim
45404,I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.,Premise
45578,"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",Claim
45743,In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.,Claim
45808,"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",Premise
45984,We're going as fast as the experts say we should.,Claim
46034,"In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.",Claim
46308,"I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",Claim
46475,Mr. Gannon.,None
46496,"Mr. President, I'd like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment.",None
46576,You have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh - in development in the Democratic Congress - Democratic-controlled Congress.,Premise
46725,"Yet at the same time the government is paying out, uh - I think it is $17 billion, perhaps $20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment.",Premise
46897,Why do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs?,Claim
47035,"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.",Claim
47163,Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.,Premise
47273,Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.,Premise
47414,Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.,Premise
47479,"In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.",Premise
47535,They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.,Premise
47603,The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.,Claim
47705,What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.,Premise
47800,"And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.",Claim
47908,"For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.",Premise
48004,"We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.",Premise
48121,We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.,Premise
48184,Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.,Premise
48231,"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.",Claim
48402,"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.",Premise
48652,"It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",Claim
48893,"Just to follow up, Mr. President: the - the Congress has just passed a three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill which would provide money for the public works jobs program that you earlier tried to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation.",None
49154,"In light of the fact that uh - unemployment again is rising - or has in the past three months - I wonder if you have rethought that question at all; whether you would consider uh - allowing this program to be funded, or will you veto that money bill?",None
49412,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.",Claim
49532,"But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.",Claim
49745,"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.",Premise
49856,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,Premise
49980,Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.,Premise
50021,"As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.",Claim
50089,"And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.",Premise
50243,Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.,Premise
50336,And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.,Premise
50483,Now he can't have it both ways.,Claim
50515,"And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.",Premise
50733,Governor Carter.,None
50759,"Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.",Premise

51877,"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.",Claim
52046,He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.,Claim
52090,There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.,Claim
52142,"And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.",Claim
52274,"This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.",Premise
52510,It's a travesty.,Claim
52527,It shows a lack of leadership.,Claim
52558,And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.,Premise

53081,You have said that you want to cut taxes for the middle and lower income groups.,None
53171,Right.,None
53185,"But unless you're willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments, or interest, or taxes, or capital gains, you can't really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size.",Premise
53445,So how are you gonna provide that tax relief that you're talking about?,None
53526,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.",Premise

54176,That's got to be changed.,Claim
54202,A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.,Premise
54473,"When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.",Claim
54552,"Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.",Premise
54845,"Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.",Premise
54959,"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.",Premise
55098,This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.,Premise
55161,"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.",Premise

56059,"Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.",Claim
56337,The average uh American person can't do it.,Claim
56381,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.,Premise
56458,"Ah - Governor, to follow up on your answer.",None
56502,Uh - in order for any kind of tax relief to really be felt by the middle and lower-income people,None
56608,Yes.,None
56613,"You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.",None
56704,Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.,None
56819,"DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.",None
56858,"uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.",None
56942,"So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?",None
57140,"No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.",Claim
57198,I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.,Claim
57248,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.",Premise
57355,"I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.",Claim
57500,"What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.",Claim
57567,And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.,Premise
57810,"These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.",Premise
58050,It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.,Claim
58270,President Ford.,None
58293,Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.,Claim
58431,In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.,Premise
58575,"Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.",Premise
58828,I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.,Claim
59023,"They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.",Premise
59229,"I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.",Claim
59320,Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.,Premise
59406,"Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.",Claim
59493,The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.,Premise
59581,"President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.",Premise

59797,My average in two years is twenty-six.,Premise
59836,But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.,Claim
59895,"And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.",None
60022,I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.,None
60156,Mr. Reynolds.,None
60181,I suspect that uhh - we could continue on this tax argument for some time.,None
60256,But I'd like to move on to another area.,None
60297,"Mr. President, uh everybody seems to be running against Washington this year.",None
60375,And I'd like to raise two coincidental events and ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country.,None
60523,"The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr, after several months and many thousands of dollars, trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people.",None
60798,At the same time.,None
60816,the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years.,None
61060,"Do you suppose, sir, that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there's something wrong in Washington, and I don't mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government?",None
61284,There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.,Premise
61356,But I think the feeling is misplaced.,Claim
61394,"In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.",Premise
61536,"The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.",Claim
61638,"For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.",Premise
61779,It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.,Premise
61890,I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.,Claim
62004,"We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.",Premise
62243,"Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.",Premise
62322,And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.,Claim
62419,"So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.",Claim
62669,They spend too much money on themselves.,Premise
62710,They have too many employees.,Premise
62740,There's some question about their morality.,Premise
62784,"It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.",Claim
63007,That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.,Claim
63170,"Mr. President, if I may follow up.",None
63205,Uh - I think you've made it plain that you take a dim view of the uh - majority in the Congress.,None
63302,"Isn't it quite likely, sir, that you will have a Democratic Congress in the next session, if you are elected president?",None
63422,"And hasn't the country uh - a right to ask whether you can get along with that Congress, or whether we'll have continued confrontation?",None
63565,"Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.",Claim
63684,We will make some gains in the United States Senate.,Premise
63737,"So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.",Premise
63876,"But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.",None
63932,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.,Premise
64048,"He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.",Premise
64252,I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.,Claim
64373,"We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.",Premise
64499,"If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.",Premise
64786,"I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",Claim
64944,Governor Carter.,None
64970,"Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.",Claim
65027,It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.,Claim

65139,"Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.",Premise
65247,"Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.",Premise
65340,"Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.",Premise
65495,I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.,Premise
65608,This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.,Premise
65712,"This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.",Premise
65931,We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.,Premise
66031,"And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.",Claim
66346,"That, I think, is a good balance.",Claim
66380,"But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.",Premise
66450,"Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.",Claim
66581,"And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.",Premise
66713,I might go back to one other thing.,None
66749,Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.,Claim
66832,"That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.",Premise
67123,"President Ford, Governor Carter, we no longer have enough time for two complete sequences of questions.",None
67227,We have only about six minutes left for questions and answers.,None
67290,For that reason we will drop the follow-up questions at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the other's answers.,None
67430,"Uh - to the extent that you can, gentlemen, please keep your remarks brief.",None
67506,Mr. Gannon.,None
67527,"Governor Carter, one uh - important uh - part of the Government's economic policy uh - apparatus we haven't talked about is the Federal Reserve Board.",None
67678,I'd like to ask you something about what you've said and that is that uh - you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whose views are compatible with his own.,None
67877,"Based on the record of the last few years, would you say that your views are compatible with those of Chairman Arthur Burns?",None
68002,"And if not, would you seek his resignation if you are elected?",None
68074,"What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.",Claim
68280,The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.,None
68361,The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.,None
68502,"The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.",Claim
68704,"They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.",Premise
69040,I would have uh - done it opposite.,Claim
69076,"I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.",Claim
69334,But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.,Claim
69403,I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.,Claim
69490,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.",Claim
69793,"President Ford, your response.",None
69831,The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.,Premise
69896,"Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.",Premise
69978,As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.,Claim
70067,Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.,Premise
70209,They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.,Claim
70361,It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.,Premise
70494,It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.,Claim
70654,Mrs. Drew.,None
70672,"Uh Mr. President, the real problem with the FBI and, in fact, all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them.",Claim
70809,Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open-ended.,Premise
70865,"Now, you have issued some executive orders, but we've learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and, in fact, the country in a great deal of trouble.",Claim
71060,"One president may be a decent man, the next one might not be.",Premise
71122,"So, what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies?",None

71493,We've done that by executive order.,Premise
71529,Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.,Claim
71658,It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.,Claim
71757,"Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.",Premise
72024,"This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.",Premise
72120,"But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.",Premise
72228,"So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.",Claim

19857,"Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.",Premise
20236,"I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.",Premise

20544,The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.,Premise
20605,"We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.",Premise

21181,"In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.",Claim
21523,It just isn't true.,Claim
21543,"And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.",Claim
21642,"Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?",None

23688,The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.,Claim
23794,"We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.",None

25067,They didn't volunteer the information.,None
25106,He had to be subpoenaed.,None
25131,"And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.",Premise
25319,"That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",Claim
25407,"Mr. Trewhitt, a question for Governor Carter.",None
25464,"Governor, I'd like to pick up on that point, actually, and on your appeal for a greater measure of American idealism in foreign affairs.",None

27492,"This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.",Claim
27822,We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.,Premise
27884,And it's an overall sign of weakness.,Claim
27922,"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.",Premise
28127,"It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.",Premise

29399,Do I have it correctly?,None
29432,"If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",Claim
29625,And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.,Premise

43860,"I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.",Premise

44344,"Mr. President, let me follow that up by - I'll submit that the cruise missile adds a - a whole new dimension to the - to the arms competition - and then cite a statement by your office to the Arms Control Association a few days ago in which you said the cruise missile might eventually be included in a comprehensive arms limitation agreement but that in the meantime it was an essential of the American strategic arsenal.",None
44767,"Now, uh - may I assume that from that you're tending to exclude the cruise missile from the next SALT agreement, or is it still negotiable in that context?",None

47133,"Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.",Premise
47340,This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.,Claim
47500,We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.,Claim
47568,If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.,Claim
47702,This has got to be stopped.,Claim
47730,That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,Claim
47843,"Mr. Valeriani, a question for Governor Carter.",None
47902,"Governor Carter, earlier tonight you said America is not strong any more; America is not respected any more.",None
48011,"And I feel that I must ask you: Do you really believe that the United States is not the strongest country in the world, do you really believe that the United States is not the most respected country in the world?",None

48268,"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.",Claim
48305,I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.,Claim
48370,I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.,Claim
48474,"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",Premise
49176,"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.",Claim
49249,And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.,Claim

49525,This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.,Claim
49617,And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.,Claim
49697,"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",Premise

51410,The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.,Claim
51526,"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?",None
51659,Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.,Claim
51813,"Mr. Frankel, a question for President Ford.",None
51867,"Mr. President, can we stick with morality?",None
51910,Uh - for a lot of people it seems to cover uh - a bunch of sins.,None
51975,Uh - Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger used to tell us that instead of morality we had to worry in the - in the world about living and letting live all kinds of governments that we really don't like.,None
52169,"North and South Korean dictators, Chilean fascists, uh - Chinese Communists, Iranian emperors and so on.",None
52274,They said the only way to get by in a wicked world was to treat others on the basis of how they treated us and not how they treated their own people.,None
52424,"But more recently, uhh - we seemed to've taken a different tack.",None
52489,"Uhh - we've seemed to have decided that it - that it is part of our business to tell the Rhodesians, for instance, that the way they're treating their own black people is wrong and they've got to change their government and we've put pressure an them.",None
52741,We were rather liberal in our advice to the Italians as to how to vote.,None
52813,Umm - is this a new Ford foreign policy in the making?,None
52868,"Can we expect that you are now going to turn to South Africa and force them to change their governments, to intervene in similar ways to end the bloodshed, as you called it, say, in Chile or Chilean prisons, and throw our weight around for the - for the values that - that we hold dear in the world?",None
53175,I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.,Claim
53262,And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.,Claim
53421,"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",Premise
53590,"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",Premise
53796,"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.",Premise

54128,"Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.",Premise
54256,"He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.",Premise

55521,"Mr. President, just clarify one paint: There are lots of majorities in the world that feel they're being pushed around by minority governments.",None
55665,"And are you saying they can now expect to look to us for not just good cheer but throwing our weight on their side - in South Africa, or on Taiwan, or in Chile, uh - to help change their governments, as in Rhodesia?",None
55888,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",None

57433,Governor Carter.,None
57459,I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.,Claim

62805,"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.",Claim

67271,But we ought to stand staunch.,Claim
67302,And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.,Claim
67534,President Ford.,None
67557,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.,Claim
67594,The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.,Premise

67956,And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Premise
68180,Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Premise
68402,And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.,Premise

69591,"If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.",Claim
69797,But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.,Claim
69875,Governor Carter.,None
69901,"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.",Claim

3805,"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.",Claim
4129,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",Premise

5425,"I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",Premise
5549,"With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.",Premise
5817,"Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.",Premise

6759,"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.",Premise
6975,"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country.""",Premise
7070,"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",Claim
7227,Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.,Claim
7297,We can also have a- an end to the extremes.,Claim
7341,"We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.",Premise
7608,"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.",Premise
7730,"So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.",Premise
7969,"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.",Claim
8154,I know I'm ready for it.,Claim

8295,"Governor, by all indications, the voters are so turned off by this election campaign so far that only half intend to vote.",Claim
8418,One major reason for this apathetic electorate appears to be the low level at which this campaign has been conducted.,Premise
8536,It has digressed frequently from important issues into allegations of blunder and brainwashing and fixations on lust and Playboy.,Premise
8666,What responsibility do you accept for the low level of this campaign for the nation's highest office?,None
8777,I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.,Claim
8974,"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",Premise
9363,"Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",Premise
9719,And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.,Premise

10232,"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.",Claim
10396,"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.",Premise
10554,"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",Claim
10836,"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",Claim
11230,"I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.",Premise
11365,"Thank you, Governor Carter.",None

18256,"I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.",Claim
18560,And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.,Claim

23605,Uh - they don't feel that uh - they know you or the people around you.,Premise

25383,"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.",None
25528,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,Claim
25628,I chose Senator Walter Mondale.,Premise

25929,"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.",Claim
26129,Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.,None
26172,"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",None

27106,"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.",Premise
27367,If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.,Premise
27480,"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",Claim
27680,Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.,Claim
27840,So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.,Claim
27924,"And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",Premise

28399,Uh - one of the heartening things is that uh - I and my colleagues have received uh - literally hundreds and maybe even thousands of suggested questions from ordinary citizens all across the country who want answers.,None
28623,That's a tribute to their interest in this election.,None
28684,I'll give you that.,None

29102,"Uh - they wanna know a-a bipartisan organization such as the National League of Conservation Voters says that when it comes to environmental issues, you are - and I'm quoting - ""hopeless.""",None
29298,"Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight.",None
29348,"I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.",Premise
29600,"Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.",Premise
29842,"So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.",Premise

30421,"I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.",Premise

30688,"For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.",Premise
30819,"And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.",Premise
30989,"And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",Premise
31211,Governor Carter.,None
31237,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.",Claim
31323,This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.,Claim
31385,Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.,Claim
31594,"The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.",Claim
31789,And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.,Premise
31918,There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.,Premise

32220,We have no energy policy.,Premise
32246,"We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.",Claim
32552,The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.,Claim
32640,"We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.",Premise
32830,Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.,Premise
32945,"But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.",Premise

35074,Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.,Premise
35143,And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.,Premise

36188,"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.",Premise
36381,"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.",Premise
36559,One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.,Premise
36663,And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.,Claim
36750,"And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.",Claim

47458,"Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.",Premise
47757,The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.,Premise

48549,Those are the people who ought to be in jail.,Premise
48595,"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",Claim
48796,"But Mr. President, don't you think that the proliferation of the availability of handguns contributes to the possibility of those crimes being committed.",None
48950,"And, there's a second part to my follow-up, very quickly.",None
49008,"There are, as you know and as you've said, jurisdictions around the country with strong gun-control laws.",None

50489,"I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.",Premise
50578,"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.",Premise
50860,"I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.",Claim

51022,Mr. Nelson to Governor Carter.,None
51062,"Uh Governor, you've said the uh - Supreme Court of today is, uh - as you put it, moving back in a proper direction uh - in rulings that have limited the rights of criminal defendants.",None
51246,And you've compared the present Supreme Court under Chief Justice Burger very favorably with the more liberal court that we had under Chief Justice Warren.,None
51402,"So exactly what are you getting at, and can you elaborate on the kind of court you think this country should have?",None
51517,And can you tell us the kind of qualifications and philosophy you would look for as president in making Supreme Court appointments?,None
51658,"While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.",Premise
51770,"We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.",Premise
51949,"And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.",Premise
52161,"Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.",Premise
52445,"And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.",Premise
52510,So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.,Claim
52579,"And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.",Claim
52714,"Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.",Claim
52872,"Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.",Premise
53033,"The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.",Premise
53213,The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.,Premise
53292,Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.,Claim
53400,Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.,None
53522,But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.,None
53689,And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.,None
53826,"But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.",None
54088,And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.,None
54183,"Governor, I don't believe you ans- you answered my question though about the kinds of uh people you would be looking for the court, the type of philosophy uh - you would be looking for if you were making appointments to the Supreme Court as president.",None
54444,"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.",Claim
54524,"Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.",Premise
54742,"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.",Claim
54982,Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.,Claim
55118,"I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.",Claim
55326,And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.,Claim
55412,I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.,Premise
55452,"He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.",Premise
55534,"The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.",Claim
55724,But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.,Premise
55882,And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.,Claim
55951,President Ford.,None
55974,"Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.",Claim
56066,"I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.",Premise
56229,"I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming.",Premise
56537,"So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.",Claim
56701,"I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.",None
56847,"It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the - uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh - do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh - were properly handled and uh - sent to jail.",None
57168,"The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.",None
57363,"Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",Claim
57625,Mr. Kraft.,None
57644,"Uh - Mr. President, uh - the country is now uh - in uh - in something that your uh - advisors call an economic pause.",None

57975,"Uh, isn't that a really rotten record and doesn't your administration bear most of the blame for it?",None
58083,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",Claim
58148,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.,Claim
58220,Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.,Premise
58316,"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",Premise
58407,But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?,Premise
58531,"Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.",Premise
58680,"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",Premise
58900,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,Premise
58961,We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,Premise

59068,"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.",Premise
59331,"Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.",Premise
59427,And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.,None
59509,"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",Premise

60941,It means that there will be increased employment.,Claim
60991,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.",Premise

414,"Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld.",None
441,"My colleagues and I agreed to participate tonight, although the questioners are limited by the constraints of the format, because we thought with the League of Women Voters, that it is desirable to seek a comparison of views on a few issues in a joint appearance by the men who would be the next President of the United States.",None

2903,"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.",Premise

3794,"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.",Premise

4211,"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",Premise
4506,"What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.",Premise
4687,I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.,Claim
4731,"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.",Claim
5075,"That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.",Claim

5339,your time is up.,None
5356,Ms. Loomis?,None

5498,"What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation?",None
5646,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.",Claim
5792,"perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.",None
5866,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",Claim
6262,"And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.",Premise
6412,"And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.",Premise
6499,You are robbing the American people of their savings.,Premise
6553,"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.",Premise
7140,"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",None
7245,"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",Premise
7470,"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.",Premise
7725,"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.",Claim
7854,"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",None
8071,Your time is up.,None
8097,...and $500 billion over the next five.,None
8146,Mr. Anderson?,None
8171,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.",Claim
8438,"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.",Premise
8565,those imports have been reduced.,None
8598,"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.",Premise
8722,"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",Premise
8916,Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.,Claim
8958,"put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.",Claim
9033,"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.",Claim
9141,their Social Security tax payments by 50%.,None
9184,"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",Claim
9310,Mr. Reagan.,None
9331,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.",Claim
9438,"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.",Premise
9529,"And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.",Claim
9664,But why?,None
9673,Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?,None
9737,Why not leave it with them?,None
9765,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.",None
9825,"or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.",None
9867,"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",Premise
10104,The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg.,None
10176,"Well, gentlemen, what I'd like to say first is, I think the panel and the audience would appreciate responsiveness to the questions, rather than repetitions of your campaign addresses.",None
10361,"My question for the Governor is: Every serious examination of the future supply of energy and other essential resources - including air, land and water - finds that we face shortages and skyrocketing prices, and that, in many ways, we're pushing the environment to dangerous limits.",None
10644,"I'd like to know, specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and general consumption, to meet problems that aren't going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?",None
10938,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.",Claim
11012,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.",Claim
11106,"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.",Premise
11320,"To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.",Claim
11444,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.",Premise
11554,But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.,Premise
11653,"And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.",Premise
11701,"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",Premise
12014,"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.",Premise
12122,"I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.",Premise
12248,"We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.",Premise

12675,"possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.",Premise
13091,"That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",Claim
13144,"I would like to say at this point that the candidates requested the same questions to be repeated, for the sake of precision, on the part of the interrogator.",None
13303,"So, Mr. Greenberg, you may address Mr. Anderson.",None

13664,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.",Claim
14046,"all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.",None
14154,"I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.",Claim
14322,"and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.",Premise
14420,"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",Premise
14594,"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.",Claim
14770,We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.,Premise
14902,"We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.",Claim
14965,"We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.",Premise
15168,"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.",Premise
15432,"Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.",Premise
15636,"According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.",Premise
15887,"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",Claim
16006,Mr. Reagan.,None
16027,"Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.",Claim
16082,I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.,None
16129,"But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.",Premise

33713,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?",None

35672,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.",Claim

36264,We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.,Premise

36698,I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.,Claim
36775,"His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.",Premise

40403,"We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.",Premise

4835,"Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.",Claim
5271,"spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.",Premise

10042,"Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.",Claim
10204,"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.",Premise
10388,"I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.",Premise
10594,"Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",Premise
11191,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",None

13496,"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.",Premise
13824,I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.,None
13904,"which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.",Premise
14031,"And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.",Premise
14265,"So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.",Claim
14494,"So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",Claim
14666,"Mr. Ellis, do you have a follow-up question for Mr. Carter?",None
14734,Yes.,None
14739,"Mr. President, you have mentioned the creation of nine million new jobs.",None
14812,"At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate.",None
14898,"Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate?",None
15049,And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they are going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?,None
15210,Yes.,Claim
15215,"We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.",Claim

15409,We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.,Premise
15473,"At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.",Premise
15618,"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.",Premise
15952,"The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.",Claim
16214,"And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.",Claim
16319,"This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.",None
16415,"Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan.",None

16534,"Governor Reagan, during the past four years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8% to currently over 12%.",Premise
16647,"And perhaps more significantly, the nation's broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7% to 9%.",Premise
16757,"Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled?",Claim
17032,"If so, specifically what measures would you pursue`?",None
17094,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.",Claim
17353,"When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.",Premise
17420,It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.,Premise
17469,It is now running at 12.7%.,Premise
17497,President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.,Premise
17555,"Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.",Premise
17667,"But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.",Premise
17839,Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.,Claim
17941,"And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.",Premise
18181,"Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.",Premise
18481,We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.,Claim
18545,We have inflation because the Government is living too well.,Claim
18606,"And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.",None
18774,I see my time is running out here.,None
18809,I'll have to get this out very fast.,None
18846,"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.",Premise
19125,And my economic plan calls for that.,Claim
19162,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.,Premise
19336,But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,Claim
19431,"A follow-up, Mr. Ellis?",None
19463,Yes.,None
19468,You have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies.,None
19569,You have also said that you would increase defense spending.,None
19630,"Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably.",None
19766,Federal revenues would shrink?,None
19806,Well.,None
19812,"most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.",None
20008,I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.,Claim
20075,"As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.",Premise
20274,We've had the Central Accounting.,None
20308,"Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.",Premise
20459,"We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.",Premise
20634,I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.,Claim
20734,And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.,Premise
20881,President Carter.,None
20908,"Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.",Claim
21065,He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.,Premise
21203,I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.,Premise
21340,"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.",Premise
21503,"This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.",Claim
21695,In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.,Premise
21853,He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees,Premise
22003,"Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Carter.",None
22044,in California.,None
22059,"Thank you, sir.",None
22083,Governor Reagan has the last word on this question.,None
22144,Yes.,None
22149,"The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.",Premise
22442,The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.,Premise
22569,"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",None
22853,"I wish that question need not be rhetorical, but it must be because we've run out of time on that.",None
22952,"Now, the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.",None
23029,Yes.,None
23034,"Governor Reagan, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in the services to the public.",None
23292,The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities.,None
23417,"What, specifically, would you do in the next four years to reverse this trend?",None
23505,"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.",Claim
23813,"Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.",Premise
23978,"And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.",Premise
24090,"The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.",Premise
24401,"And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.",Claim
24665,I think there are things to do in this regard.,Claim
24712,I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.,Premise
24797,You have to see it to believe it.,Premise

24902,"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair.""",Premise

25228,"And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.",Claim

44134,The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.,Premise
44323,"And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.",Premise
44407,"But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.",Premise
44760,The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.,Claim

44993,It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.,Premise

45263,"Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.",Premise
45405,And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.,Premise

46506,Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.,None
46645,"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.",Claim
46827,"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.",Premise
47273,The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.,Premise

47640,"You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.",Premise
47714,"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",Claim

48018,"Yes, I'd like to respond very much.",None
48054,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.",Claim
48207,"And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.",Premise
48354,"Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.",None
48640,I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.,None
48807,I am not talking of scrapping.,Claim
48838,"I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.",Claim

49169,That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.,Claim
49253,President Carter?,None
49280,Yes.,None
49285,Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.,Claim
49359,"He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.",Premise
49782,"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.",Premise
50170,This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.,Claim
50240,It would be very disturbing to American people.,Claim
50288,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.",Premise

50984,I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.,None
51100,"My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.",Claim
51248,"It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.",Premise
51364,"And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.",Claim
51549,"It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.",Premise
51676,And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.,Claim
51782,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",None
51850,"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.",None
51958,"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.",None
52081,She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.,None
52154,This is a formidable force.,Claim
52182,Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.,Premise
52235,"If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.",Premise

52420,"We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.",Premise
52496,"The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",None

52816,"Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago.",Premise
52946,"Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, and for some time to came, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression.",Premise
53196,This means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence.,Claim
53259,"Can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?",None
53463,"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.",None
53551,What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.,None
53657,"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.",None
53794,We've been very successful in both cases.,Claim
53836,We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.,Premise
53920,We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.,Premise
54011,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",Premise
54427,We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.,Premise
54500,We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.,Premise
54560,We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.,Premise
54623,"And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.",Premise
54866,"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.",Claim
55177,Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan?,None
55240,"Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago.",Premise
55354,"And yet, U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo.",Premise
55489,And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression.,Claim
55574,"The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?",None
55803,"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.",Claim
55993,"The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.",Premise
56138,The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.,Premise
56201,Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.,Claim
56312,"With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.",Premise
56406,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",Premise
56482,"The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.",Premise
56725,"Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.",Premise
56940,"It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.",Premise
57123,This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.,Premise
57200,Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.,Premise
57267,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.,None
57342,"But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.",Premise
57623,We have the sources here.,Claim
57649,"We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",Premise
57726,"President Carter, your comment?",None

57930,"Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.",Premise
58215,We cannot cast aside these regulations.,Claim
58255,"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.",Claim
58466,"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.",Premise
58913,He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.,Claim
59013,Governor Reagan.,None
59039,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.",Claim
59090,I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.,Claim

59545,"As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.",Premise
59732,And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.,Premise
59880,"And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.",Premise
59959,"So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.",Claim
60016,"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.",Claim
60353,"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",None
60425,"President Carter, another crack at that?",None
60475,Sure.,None

61096,"We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.",Premise

61383,"Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.",None
61450,Yes.,None
61455,"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.",Claim
61902,"It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.",Premise
62093,"We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.",Premise
62172,"As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.",Premise

63068,"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.",Premise
63238,"It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.",Premise
63365,"Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.",Premise
63659,"What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.",Premise
63972,"We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.",Premise
64198,"They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.",Claim
64307,"But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.",Premise

64950,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.",Claim
65104,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",Premise
65301,"I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.",Premise
65560,"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.",Claim
65735,"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.",Claim
65834,"And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.",Premise
66095,That is the way it will stay.,Claim
66133,Governor Reagan?,None
66159,"Well, that just isn't true.",Claim
66187,"It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.",Premise
66476,"Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.",None
66641,"Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.",Premise
66861,"And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.",Claim
66997,That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.,Claim
67078,"I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.",Claim
67227,There are some changes that I would like to make.,Claim
67277,"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.",Premise
67631,I'd like to change that.,Claim
67664,President Carter's rebuttal now.,None
67706,These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.,None
67860,"It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.",Claim
68090,"We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.",Premise
68308,"In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.",None
68489,"Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.",None
68603,"Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.",Premise
69070,"These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.",Claim
69168,"Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.",None

69755,"It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.",None
69826,"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",Claim
70195,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",None
70263,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.",Claim
70471,"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.",Premise
70626,These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.,Premise
70834,I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.,Premise
70941,"I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.",Premise
71104,"So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.",Claim
71318,"Thank you Mr. President, Governor Reagan.",None
71360,We now go to another question - a question to President Carter by Barbara Waiters.,None
71453,Thank you.,None
71464,"You have addressed some of the major issues tonight, but the biggest issue in the mind of American voters is yourselves - your ability to lead this country.",None
71621,"When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.",None
71735,"You have already given us your reasons why people should vote for you, now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation and, having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.",None
72069,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.",None
72180,"First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.",Claim
72253,"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.",Claim
72585,"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.",Claim
72873,"The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.",Premise
73260,"This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.",Claim
73483,"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",Premise
73881,"Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?",None
73951,"Yes, thank you.",None
73967,"Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation, and having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?",None
74268,"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.",Claim
74521,I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.,Claim
74661,"It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.",Premise
74886,"Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.",Premise
75029,"He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.",Premise
75148,He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.,Premise
75246,"Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.",Premise
75353,"But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.",None
75441,I said many foolish things back in those days.,None
75488,"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.",Premise
75606,"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.",Claim
75727,"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.",Claim
75882,It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.,Premise
75975,President Carter?,None
76002,I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.,None
76129,I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.,Claim
76264,"For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.",Premise
76385,Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.,Premise
76485,Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.,Premise
76681,"When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.",Premise
76788,And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.,Premise
76937,"That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",Claim
77200,Governor Reagan?,None
77226,Yes.,None
77231,"Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.",Premise
77433,"I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.",Premise
77667,"While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.",Premise
77987,"I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.",None
78184,"If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.",Premise
78372,"I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",Claim
78527,President Carter?,None
78554,"Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.",Premise
78773,One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.,Premise
78864,"We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.",Claim
78938,"We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.",Premise
79042,We're now working on the communications industry.,Premise
79092,"In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.",Claim
79542,We have made remarkable success.,Claim
79575,It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.,Claim
79654,"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",Premise
79809,"Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.",None
79859,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",None
79969,And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.,Claim
80021,"But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.",Claim
80367,"Those would all, could all be challenged by men.",Premise
80416,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.,Claim
80503,I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.,None

869,"The position of the candidates -- that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement -- was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates.",None
1039,"Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement.",None

2644,And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.,None
2722,Mr. Wieghart.,None
2746,The Nation's Economy,None
2779,"Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people -- in your campaign -- a balanced budget by 1983.",None
2885,We've now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you've been in office.,None
2962,"Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?",None
3116,I have a plan -- not a secret plan.,Claim
3152,"As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.",Premise
3256,"It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.",Claim
3580,"Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.",Premise
3865,"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.",Claim
4126,"Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.",Premise
4248,"Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.",Premise
4432,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.",Claim
4519,We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.,Claim
4578,"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",Premise
4672,"In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.",Premise
4920,"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.",Premise
5244,"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",Claim
5303,"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news.",None
5369,"The lines aren't about to meet, according to their projections.",Claim
5433,They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb.,Claim
5494,In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.,Premise
5558,"In view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?",None
5782,The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.,Claim
5842,"I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.",Premise
6060,But it has taken place.,None
6085,"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.",Claim
6172,If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.,Premise
6363,"At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.",Premise
6571,"And so, I think that the lines can meet.",Claim
6613,"Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.",Claim
6767,"Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn't come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.",None
6975,"You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989.",Premise
7201,That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years.,Claim
7275,What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?,None
7401,One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.,None
7517,And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.,None
7618,"I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.",Premise
7696,"But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.",Claim
7837,"As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.",Claim
7920,We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.,Claim
7974,It was $200 billion deficit instead.,Claim
8011,And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.,None
8167,"Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.",Premise
8431,"In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.",Claim
8494,It gets larger even with growth.,Claim
8528,What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.,Claim
8618,This is the worst trade year in American history by far.,Claim
8675,Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.,Claim
8735,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.",Claim
8963,I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.,Claim
9057,"I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.",Claim
9229,"I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",Claim
9332,"Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending.",Claim
9416,"The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them.",Premise
9575,"Isn't it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?",None
9741,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things --",Claim
10480,I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.,None
10614,And now it is time for the rebuttal.,None
10651,"Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.",None
10699,Yes.,None
10704,I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.,Claim
10807,"And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.",Premise
10906,"And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.",Claim
11033,"So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.",Claim

11645,Mr. Mondale?,None
11668,"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.",Premise
11782,"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.",Premise

12753,"Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale's leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news.",None
12947,"And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.",None
13107,I'd like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims -- Mr. Mondale first.,None

13538,"There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.",Claim

13765,The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.,Premise
13836,No one else believes that's the case.,Claim
13874,"I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.",Claim

13986,"There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.",Claim
14118,"What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.",Premise

14339,"The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.",Premise
14536,"There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.",Premise

15318,"You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through.",Claim
15474,"Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?",None
15607,"Well, I think we're getting better all the time.",Claim
15656,"And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.",None

16119,"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",Claim
16331,"Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms.",None
16389,"First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale's campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news?",None
16510,"And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?",None
16605,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.",None
16714,"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.",Claim
17022,"Now, leadership.",None
17039,"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.",Claim

17574,I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.,Claim
17713,"And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.",Claim
17867,"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.",Claim
17923,But I also believe something else about that.,Claim
17969,"I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.",Claim
18253,I don't want to hear them.,Claim

18457,"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",Premise
18892,"As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could -- a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign -- that it is essentially based on imagery.",None
19061,"And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly.",None
19283,Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.,None
19349,Our policy was not to cut subsidies.,Claim
19386,"We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.",Premise
19596,"And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.",Claim
19694,"We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.",Claim
19805,"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.",Claim
19894,"We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.",Claim
20120,"The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",Claim
20272,"Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.",None
20328,"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.",None

21613,Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.,None
21665,"Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.",Claim
21873,"And so, we made a proposal.",Claim
21901,"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.",Premise
21989,"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.",Premise
22090,"Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.",Claim
22146,"And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.",Claim
22270,"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",Premise
22466,"Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.",None
22530,Religion,None
22549,"Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?",None
22756,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.",None
22864,"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.",None

23099,"And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.",Claim
23372,And I do resort to prayer.,Claim
23399,"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.",Claim
23573,"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.",Claim
23707,"So, it does play a part in my life.",Claim
23743,I have no hesitancy in saying so.,Claim
23777,"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",Claim
23924,"Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don't you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?",None
24171,The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.,None
24246,"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.",Premise
24328,"And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",Claim

24624,We all know the possibility of terrorism.,Claim
24666,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,None
24744,"And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.",Claim
25010,"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.",Claim
25094,"May I ask you, please --",None
25227,"Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?",None

25965,Our family does.,Claim
25982,It is fundamental.,Claim
26001,It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.,Claim
26048,"I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.",Claim
26132,And I think we're all together on that.,Claim

26398,All history tells us that that's a mistake.,Claim
26443,"When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.",Premise
26747,This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.,Claim
26972,That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,Claim
27069,"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",Claim
27197,Thank you.,None

27875,No.,None

28578,Thank you.,None
28589,"Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.",None
28628,"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.",None
28724,"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",Claim
28826,"The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.",Claim
29158,"And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.",Claim
29272,A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.,Premise
29391,"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.",Claim
29548,"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.",None

29858,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.",None
29904,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.",None
30012,And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.,None
30074,And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.,None
30149,Let's take the example that the President cites.,None
30198,I believe in prayer.,None
30219,My family prays.,None
30236,We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.,None
30289,But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?,None
30545,Who would write the prayer?,None
30573,What would it say?,None
30592,How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?,None
30645,"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.",Claim
30844,We don't want that.,None
30875,"Thank you, Mr. Mondale.",None
30899,Our time is up for this round.,None

31143,"I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale.",None
31846,My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,None

32042,The American people want arms control.,Claim
32081,They don't want this arms race.,Claim
32113,And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.,Claim

32426,"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",Premise

32683,The American people want this environment protected.,Claim
32736,"They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.",Claim

33298,They want those civil rights laws enforced.,Claim
33342,They want the equal rights amendment ratified.,Claim
33389,They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,Claim

33584,"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",Claim
33683,"Mr. Mondale, isn't it possible that the American people have heard your message -- and they are listening -- but they are rejecting it?",None
33829,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",None
33885,The President says it'll disappear automatically.,None
33935,I've said it's going to take some work.,Claim

34265,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",Claim
34536,"Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th.",None
34737,"What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?",None
34823,"Well, again, I'm running on the record.",None
34863,I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.,None
34918,But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.,None
34975,"We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.",Claim
35278,"And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.",Claim
35402,"And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.",None
35650,"I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.",Claim
35715,"We have, to one-third of what it was.",Claim
35753,I promised that we would reduce taxes.,Claim
35792,"We did, 25 percent across the board.",Claim
35829,That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.,None
35930,But at least it took that burden away from them.,Claim
35980,"I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.",Claim
36082,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",Claim
36341,We have done that.,Claim
36361,"All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.",Claim
36514,And I think this is something the American people see.,Claim
36570,I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.,Claim
36708,"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.",Premise
36930,We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,Claim
37049,All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.,Claim
37165,"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",Claim
37306,"Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans -- their income, the way they live, and so forth -- but there's an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment.",None
37611,"In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can't create the kind of environment that he might like.",None

38387,"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.",Claim
38464,"When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.",Claim
38759,And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,Claim
38833,"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.",Claim
38911,"I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.",None

39188,"The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.",None
39265,The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.,None
39379,"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''",Premise
39497,"Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.",Claim
39595,"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",Premise
39764,The President just said that his government is shrinking.,Premise
39822,It's not.,Claim
39832,It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.,Claim
39924,"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",Premise
40106,That's where government should not be.,Claim
40156,Mr. President?,None
40180,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.",Claim
40336,"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",Claim
40382,I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.,Claim
40430,I found that was rather difficult to do.,Claim
40471,But I finally did it.,Claim
40493,"There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.",None
40608,Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.,None
40657,The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.,Claim
40731,"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",Premise
40947,"All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.",Claim
41052,"As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.",Premise

41295,Diane?,None
41304,Abortion,None
41323,"I'd like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences -- and that is abortion and right to life.",None
41588,I'm exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.,None
41705,"First, Mr. President.",None
41727,Do you consider abortion murder or a sin?,None
41769,"And second, how hard would you work -- what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal?",None
41903,"And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be prolife?",None
42036,I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.,Claim
42186,"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.",Claim
42288,"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",Premise
42479,"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.",Claim
42563,"I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.",Claim
42801,"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",Premise
43075,"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",Claim
43184,"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",Claim
43265,"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",None
43396,"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",Premise
43771,"Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?",Claim
43942,"And it used the term ""death of the unborn child.''",Premise
43994,"So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",Claim
44191,A two-part followup.,None
44212,"Do I take it from what you've said about the platform, then, that you don't regard the language and don't regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices -- that it should be?",None
44423,"And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced?",None
44494,Who would be the policing units that would investigate?,None
44550,And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?,None
44625,The laws regarding that always were State laws.,None
44673,It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.,None
44810,Our laws against murder are State laws.,Claim
44850,"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.",Claim
44921,"As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.",Claim
44978,And no one has approached it from that matter.,Claim
45025,It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.,Premise
45108,I know that some churches do.,Claim
45139,"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.",Claim
45187,"At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.",Premise
45302,"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",Claim
45548,"Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin?",None
45621,"And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn't know whether life does -- human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.",None
45949,This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.,None
46036,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",None
46241,The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.,Claim
46400,"Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?",Claim
46581,"I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.",Claim
46676,Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.,Claim
46738,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.,Claim
46807,"I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.",Claim
46910,Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.,Claim
46973,But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.,Claim
47055,"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.",Premise
47130,Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.,Premise
47178,That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.,Claim
47251,But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?,None
47319,Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?,Claim
47438,"I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.",Claim
47512,"In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.",Claim
47615,We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.,Claim
47711,It's been a good instinct.,Claim
47738,And we're the most religious people on Earth.,Claim
47785,"One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",Claim
47949,"But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins -- a two-part followup.",None
48074,"First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus?",None
48166,"And second of all, you said that government shouldn't be involved in the decisions.",None
48250,"Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980.",None
48387,And how do you feel about that?,None
48429,"The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.",None
48567,"And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.",Claim
48616,I don't know the answer to when life begins.,Claim
48661,"And it's not that simple, either.",Claim
48695,You've got another life involved.,Premise
48729,"And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",Claim
48788,"If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",Claim
48845,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?,Claim
48971,It won't work.,Claim
49007,"I'm sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.",None
49069,You're all invited guests.,None
49096,"I know I'm wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud -- sometimes louder, less loud -- and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.",None
49300,We have our time now for rebuttal.,None
49335,Mr. President.,None
49360,Yes.,None
49365,"Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?",None
49546,"Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.",Claim
49678,I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.,Claim
49792,I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.,Claim
49946,"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.",Premise
50048,"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?",None
50340,There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.,Claim
50477,Mr. Mondale.,None
50500,"I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.",Claim
50718,I'm all for that.,None
50736,But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.,Claim
50827,And I don't agree with it.,Claim
50854,"Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.",None
50914,The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.,None
50964,"Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.",Premise
51046,"And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.",Claim
51171,It's been a big failure.,Claim
51196,I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.,Claim
51246,I'm opposed to these policies as well.,Claim
51296,"I'm sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things -- because one did it, the other one did it.",None
51426,May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is.,None
51499,"And also, foreign policy will be the next debate.",None
51549,Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one.,None
51953,Thank you.,None
51964,"Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay.",None
52045,"Now, I'm talking not about the rich or the poor -- I know your views on their taxes -- but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year.",None
52184,Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?,None
52282,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.",Claim
52487,"Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.",Premise
52694,"That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.",Claim
52928,What does this mean in real life?,None
52962,"Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.",Premise
53053,"He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.",None
53120,In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.,Claim
53171,"In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.",Premise
53275,That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.,Claim
53409,I believe we need some fairness.,Claim
53442,And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.,Claim
53624,"It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes.",None
53792,"I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up -- their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars.",None
54003,"Wouldn't that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?",None
54108,"The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.",None
54183,"Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.",None
54306,And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.,None
54393,They're the same thing.,None
54417,They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.,Claim
54512,"Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.",Premise
54603,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.",Premise
54706,I don't think we can do that for a few years.,Claim
54752,"But at some point, we want to do that as well.",Claim
54809,"Mr. President, let me try this on you.",None
54848,Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?,None
54923,"You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.",None
54989,There you go again.,Claim
57117,"I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you've made before.",None
57232,"I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that ""I'm not going to raise taxes.''",None
57417,"Is that what you meant to say, that you will not -- that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President?",None
57549,"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me.",None
57608,"If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.",Claim
58074,"I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.",Claim
58177,"With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.",Claim
58501,"All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",Premise
58619,"Mr. Mondale, here we go again.",None
58650,It's time for rebuttal.,None
58684,"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.",None
58759,"I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.",None
58887,They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.,None
58955,"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?",None
59025,Yes.,None
59040,You remember the last time you said that?,None
59091,Mm-hmm.,None
59109,"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr.",None
59232,President.'',None
59245,And what did you do right after the election?,None
59291,You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.,None
59350,"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know.",None
59761,"Mr. Mondale, I'm afraid your time is up.",None
59812,Sorry.,None
59829,Mr. President?,None
59853,Yes.,None
59858,"With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.",Claim
60087,"And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.",Claim
60235,And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.,Premise
60393,All right.,None
60404,Fine.,None
60419,I gave you back some of that time.,None
60475,We can't keep going back for other rebuttals; there'll be time later.,None
60545,We now go to our final round.,None
60575,"The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane.",None

60757,"Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven.",None
60815,"The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.",None
60980,"There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans -- working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor.",None

61407,"What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs?",None
61562,"What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?",None
61630,"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.",None
61689,"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.",Premise
61823,"It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.",Claim
61874,"On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.",Claim
62037,"We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.",Claim
62151,It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.,Claim
62244,We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.,Claim
62364,"We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.",Claim
62453,"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.",Claim
62745,We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.,Claim
62835,We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.,Claim
62926,"Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.",None
63028,Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.,None
63146,"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.",Claim
63315,We didn't think that was right.,Claim
63347,"And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.",Claim
63513,"So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.",None
63673,"7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",None

64113,Yes.,None
64129,"In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe -- 5.6 percent.",None
64276,"And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone.",None
64350,What did you mean by that comment?,None
64385,"And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.",None
64576,That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.,None
64662,"I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.",None
64722,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",None

24216,"Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state.",Claim
24310,"I'm taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that's the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion.",Premise

25199,What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state.,None
25328,"The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I've been the person that they're speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches.",Claim
25770,"I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right.",Claim
25874,But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn't support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion.,Claim
26138,"Now there are numerous groups who don't support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups.",Claim
26240,Are they intolerant of religion?,None

28468,"Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal?",Claim
28516,"Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas - one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices.",Premise

42714,I take responsibility.,None

44154,"There's legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and that's to gather intelligence information for our security.",None

61935,I agree.,None
61944,"But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn't a realistic proposal.",Claim
62063,"And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles.",Premise

62484,That proposal was turned down by the administration - a proposal presented by its own administrator.,Premise
62585,"Now I'm delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well.",Claim

63782,"Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those - we tried to reduce the SS-18's and those weapons.",Claim
63880,"But then we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes.",Premise

65422,That's number one.,Claim
65441,I don't think you can start negotiating until you start talking.,Premise
65506,"Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty.",Premise
65780,That was done in 1960.,None
65803,"I don't know what your lights are doing, Sander.",None
65862,You have another minute.,None
65897,Okay.,None
65903,I'm watching them blinking.,None
65931,So I have another minute.,Claim
65957,What that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty.,Premise
66048,That was done in 1960 by President Kennedy - in 1963.,Premise
66102,What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union.,Premise

67112,Are you saying that I would have to have fought in the war in order to love peace?,None
67202,"I'm not saying that, I'm asking you - you know what I asked.",None
67273,All right.,Claim
67284,"I think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not I have had military experience, that's the natural conclusion.",Claim
67409,"It's about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that you'd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism.",None
67572,And that's just not so.,Claim
67596,"I think if you take a look at where I've been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am - I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender.",Claim
67804,I don't think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if I'm ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union.,None
67990,Quite frankly I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained.,Claim
68120,"Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation.",Claim
68406,Let me just say one other thing now.,None
68443,"The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where you're not put into that position.",Claim
68581,And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision - armed force or anything else - is by moving toward arms control.,Claim
68728,And that's not what's been done over the past four years.,Claim
68786,I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one.,Claim
68899,I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country.,Claim
68967,I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations.,None

69242,"Oh, I don't have a single-most question.",Claim
69283,I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country.,None
69404,"My concern is that we are not doing anything to stop the arms race, and if seems to me that if we keep talking about military inferiority - which we do not have, we are at a comparable level with the Soviet Union; our Joint Chiefs of Staff have said they'd never exchange our military power for theirs.",Claim
69707,I guess the thing that I'd want is a commitment that pretty soon they're going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us.,None
69856,"Vice-President Bush, four years ago President Reagan insisted that a military buildup would bring the Soviets to negotiate seriously.",None
69990,"Since then, we have spent almost a trillion dollars on defense but the Soviets are still building their military forces as rapidly as we are, and there are no negotiations.",None

70297,You've got to go back where we were.,None
70334,"Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things.",Premise
70469,"Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldn't go out to sea.",Claim
70581,And you had a major problem with the military.,Claim
70628,"Actually, the morale wasn't very good either.",Claim
70674,So we have had to strengthen the military and we're well on the way to getting that job done.,Claim
70768,"America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace.",None

71206,"The chemical weapon treaty to ban all chemical weapons, it was our initiative, not the Soviets.",Claim
71302,And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word.,Claim
71438,"But, much more important, you'd reduce the level of terror.",Claim
71498,"Similarly, we're reducing - trying to talk to them, and are talking to them, in Vienna, about conventional force reduction.",Premise
71622,We've talked to them about human rights.,Premise
71663,"I've met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question.",Premise
71784,The suppression of Soviet Jews is absolutely intolerable and so we have to keep pushing forward on the moral grounds as well as on the arms reduction ground.,Claim
71942,"But it is my view that because this president has been strong, and because we've addressed the imbalances - and I think we're very close to getting that job done - the Soviets are more likely to make a deal.",Premise
72150,The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system.,None
72235,"So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control.",Claim
72442,"And now, I'll give you a chance, Mr.",None
72479,"Vice-President, to ask the question you'd most like to ask your opponent.",None
72560,"I have none I'd like to ask of her, but I'd sure like to use the time to talk about the World Series or something of that nature.",None

73406,Nothing on the World Series?,None
73435,Congresswoman Ferraro?,Claim
73468,I think the vice-president's comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration.,Claim

73661,I must say that I'm also tickled by their comments on human rights.,Claim
73729,"The Soviet Union in 1979 allowed 51,000 people to emigrate, because, in large measure, this administration's policies over the past four years, 1,313 people got out of the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984.",Premise

1507,"You and the Democratic Party have said that the only policy toward the horrendous civil wars in Central America should be on the economic development and negotiations, with perhaps a quarantine of Marxist Nicaragua.",None
1723,Do you believe that these answers would in any way solve the bitter conflicts there?,None
1808,Do you really believe that there is no need to resort to force at all?,None
1879,"Are not the solutions to Central America's gnawing problems simply, again, too weak and too late?",None
1987,I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.,Claim
2086,"Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.",Premise
2236,"To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.",Premise
2637,That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace  This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.,Premise
2974,"I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.",Claim
3185,"A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.",Premise
3302,"We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.",Premise
3384,"But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.",Claim
3518,"The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.",Premise
3611,"And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.",Premise
3949,A President is called the Commander in Chief.,Premise
3995,And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.,Premise
4126,"Mr. Mondale, if I could broaden the question just a little bit: Since World War II, every conflict that we as Americans have been involved with has been in non-conventional or irregular terms.",None
4319,"And yet, we keep fighting in conventional or traditional military terms.",None
4392,"The Central American wars are very much in the same pattern as China, as Lebanon, as Iran, as Cuba, in their early days.",None
4513,"Do you see any possibility that we are going to realize the change in warfare in our time, or react to it in those terms?",None
4646,"We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.",Claim
4729,It's much more complex.,None
4753,You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.,Premise
4926,That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.,Claim
4981,"That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.",Premise
5152,"Strength requires knowledge, command.",None
5190,"We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.",Premise
5367,"Mr. President, in the last few months it has seemed more and more that your policies in Central America were beginning to work.",Claim
5495,"Yet, just at this moment, we are confronted with the extraordinary story of a CIA guerrilla manual for the anti-Sandinista contras whom we are backing, which advocates not only assassinations of Sandinistas but the hiring of criminals to assassinate the guerrillas we are supporting in order to create martyrs.",Premise
5806,"Is this not, in effect, our own state-supported terrorism?",None
5874,"No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.",Claim
5960,I have ordered an investigation.,Premise
5993,I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.,Premise
6048,"We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.",Premise
6176,And he drew up this manual.,Premise
6204,It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.,Premise
6281,"And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.",Premise
6449,"But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.",Premise
6594,"Now, those are the details as we have them.",None
6638,"And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.",Claim
6812,We'll take the proper action at the proper time.,Claim
6862,"I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.",Premise
7267,"So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.",Premise
7430,"But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.",Claim
7552,"Well, Mr. President, you are implying then that the CIA in Nicaragua is directing the contras there.",Claim
7653,I'd also like to ask whether having the CIA investigate its own manual in such a sensitive area is not sort of like sending the fox into the chicken coop a second time?,None
7831,I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.,Premise
7890,There's not someone there directing all of this activity.,Premise
7948,"There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.",Premise
8058,"And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",Premise
8336,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal.",None
8374,What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?,None
8447,He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.,None
8557,"A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.",Claim
8703,"This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.",Premise
8865,"Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.",Premise
8950,How can this happen?,None
8971,How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?,None
9116,A President must know these things.,Claim
9152,"I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.",None
9226,And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?,Premise
9314,"This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.",Premise
9391,"Mr. President, your rebuttal.",None
9430,Yes.,None
9435,"I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.",None
9528,"You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.",None
9713,"I never, ever conceived of such a thing.",Claim
9754,I never said any such thing.,Claim
9783,"In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.",Premise
10167,"But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.",Claim
10275,"How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.",Premise
10428,"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.",None
10491,I'm sure that you appreciate that.,None
10547,"Mr. Kalb, your question to President Reagan.",None
10593,Soviet Union,None
10614,"Mr. President, you have often described the Soviet Union as a powerful, evil empire intent on world domination.",None
10726,"But this year you have said, and I quote.",None
10768,"""If they want to keep their Mickey Mouse system, that's okay with me.''",Claim
10840,"Which is it, Mr. President?",None
10868,Do you want to contain them within their present borders and perhaps try to reestablish detente -- or what goes for detente -- or do you really want to roll back their empire?,None
11053,I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.,Premise
11137,I retract nothing that I have said.,None
11173,I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.,Claim
11272,"But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.",Claim
11374,And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.,Premise
11425,They don't like ours.,None
11447,"And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.",Claim
11536,"But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.",Claim
11603,"And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.",Claim
11771,And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.,Claim
11842,I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.,Claim
11913,"I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.",Premise
12100,And the result was unilateral disarmament.,Premise
12143,We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.,Premise
12200,What did we get for it?,Premise
12224,Nothing.,None
12234,"The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.",Premise
12417,And now we are putting up a defense of our own.,Premise
12465,"And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.",Claim
12526,We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.,Premise
12664,"Now, they claim they're not.",None
12693,"And I made it plain to them, we're not.",Claim
12733,There's been no change in my attitude at all.,Claim
12779,I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.,None
12896,And we did get their attention.,None
12930,Regions Vital to U.S.,None
12952,Interests,None

13555,"I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.",Claim
13709,"One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.",Claim
13887,Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.,Claim
13934,"We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.",Premise
14121,"So, I can say there are a great many interests.",Claim
14169,I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.,Claim
14231,That is where I think the future of the world lies.,Claim
14283,"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''",None

14700,"In that case, what makes you think that the annual summit meetings with them that you have proposed will result in agreements that would satisfy the interests of this country?",Premise
14886,"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.",Premise
15234,I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.,Claim
15317,"They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.",Claim
15421,"Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.",Premise
15588,"And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.",Claim
15745,"And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.",Premise
15875,"There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.",Premise
16006,"We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.",Claim
16240,There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.,Claim
16305,I will keep this nation strong.,Claim
16337,"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.",Premise
16433,"To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.",Claim
16532,"And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.",Premise
16658,He's 3 years into this administration.,Premise
16697,"He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.",Premise
16805,I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.,Premise

17272,Do you accept the conventional diplomatic wisdom that Eastern Europe is a Soviet sphere of influence?,None
17374,"And if you do, what could a Mondale administration realistically do to help the people of Eastern Europe achieve the human rights that were guaranteed to them as a result of the Helsinki accords?",Claim
17580,I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.,Claim
17689,We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.,Claim

17889,"Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.",Premise
18112,Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.,None
18161,That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.,None

18393,Yes.,None
18398,I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.,None

18716,"And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.",None
19281,"Hear, hear!",Premise
19302,"Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.",Premise

20668,Use of Military Force,Claim
20703,"Mr. Mondale, in an address earlier this year you said that before this country resorts to military force, and I'm quoting, ""American interests should be sharply defined, publicly supported, congressionally sanctioned, militarily feasible, internationally defensible, open to independent scrutiny, and alert to regional history.''",None
21033,"Now, aren't you setting up such a gauntlet of tests here that adversaries could easily suspect that as President you would never use force to protect American interests?",Claim
21213,No.,Claim
21217,"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",Premise
21332,And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.,Premise
21392,"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.",Premise
21616,"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.",Premise
21793,"Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.",Claim
22087,"We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.",Claim

22714,I'd like to know what that means.,None
22748,"Would you stop Soviet ships, as President Kennedy did in 1962?",None
22811,And wouldn't that be more dangerous than President Reagan's covert war?,Premise
22893,"What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.",Claim
23298,"The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.",Claim

24232,"No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.",Premise
24282,"First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.",Premise
24539,"But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.",None
24708,Israel could not be blamed for that.,Premise
24745,"Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.",Premise

24991,We departed.,Premise

25493,"I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.",None
25638,And this is what we did.,Claim
25663,We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.,Premise
25732,"But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.",Claim
25988,"We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.",Claim
26051,"There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.",Premise
26240,"And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.",Claim
26369,Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.,Claim
26526,But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.,None

32574,And we agreed.,None
32589,"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''",Premise
32643,"But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.",None
32801,"So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?",None

39018,They are saying that it is the only real territorial threat to the American nation-state.,Premise
39108,"You, yourself, said in the 1970's that we had a ""hemorrhage on our borders.''",Premise
39186,"Yet today you have backed off any immigration reform, such as the balanced and highly crafted Simpson-Mazzoli bill.",None
39302,Why?,None
39307,"What would you do instead today, if anything?",Premise
39363,"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.",Claim
39439,I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.,None
39544,That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.,Premise
39651,"I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.",Claim
39829,I think that's wrong.,Premise
39851,"We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.",Claim
39967,That is counterproductive.,Premise
39994,"I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.",Premise
40307,"I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.",Claim
40623,"We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.",Premise
40742,"Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.",Premise
40809,"We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.",Premise
40906,And one of those dreams is justice.,Claim
40942,And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.,Premise
41092,The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.,Claim
41176,We cannot solve this problem all on our own.,Premise
41221,"And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",Premise
41537,"Sir, people as well-balanced and just as Father Theodore Hesburgh at Notre Dame, who headed the select commission on immigration, have pointed out repeatedly that there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions, because it would be an unbalanced bill, and there would be simply no way to enforce it.",Premise
41852,"However, putting that aside for the moment, your critics have also said repeatedly that you have not gone along with the bill or with any immigration reform because of the Hispanic groups -- or Hispanic leadership groups -- who actually do not represent what the Hispanic-Americans want, because polls show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform.",None
42222,"Can you say, or how can you justify your position on this?",None
42281,"And how do you respond to the criticism that this is another, or that this is an example of your flip-flopping and giving in to special interest groups at the expense of the American nation?",Premise
42482,"I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.",Premise
42613,"I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.",Premise
42801,This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.,Premise
42930,"And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.",Premise
43034,"If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.",Claim
43118,"I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.",Claim
43288,"And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.",Claim
43523,"Mr. President, you, too, have said that our borders are out of control.",Premise
43595,Yet this fall you allowed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill -- which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship -- because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the States for legalized aliens.,None
43835,"Given that, may I ask what priority can we expect you to give this forgotten national security element?",None
43939,"How sincere are you in your efforts to control, in effect, the nation-state that is the United States?",Claim
44051,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.",Premise
44170,"However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.",Premise
44307,And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.,Claim
44496,There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.,None
44560,I can't go into detail about them here.,Claim
44600,But it is true our borders are out of control.,Premise
44647,It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.,None
44751,And I supported this bill.,Premise
44778,I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.,Premise
44928,"With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.",Claim
45527,We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.,Claim
45607,"And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.",Claim
45903,"And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.",Premise
46090,"But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.",Premise
46246,And we work with those other countries.,Claim
46295,"Mr. President, the experts also say that the situation today is terribly different quantitatively -- qualitatively different from what it has been in the past because of the gigantic population growth.",Premise
46497,"For instance, Mexico's population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century.",Premise
46610,"Many of these people will be coming into the United States not as citizens, but as illegal workers.",None
46710,"You have repeatedly said recently that you believe that Armageddon, the destruction of the world, may be imminent in our times.",None
46838,"Do you ever feel that we are in for an Armageddon or a situation, a time of anarchy, regarding the population explosion in the world?",Claim
46981,No.,Claim
46985,"As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.",Premise
47116,"As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.",Premise
47275,"It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.",Claim
47431,"But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.",Premise
47514,"And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.",Claim
47729,"And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.",None
47884,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?",Claim
47922,"One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.",Premise
48126,"And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.",Claim
48397,"And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.",Premise
48532,"These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.",Claim
48783,"And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.",None
48896,"Mr. President, your rebuttal.",Premise
48935,"Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border --",None
49458,"No applause, please.",None
49479,"Mr. Kalb, your question to President Reagan.",None
49526,Armageddon,None
49545,"Mr. President, I'd like to pick up this Armageddon theme.",Claim
49603,"You've been quoted as saying that you do believe, deep down, that we are heading for some kind of biblical Armageddon.",Premise
49722,Your Pentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the United States to fight and prevail in a nuclear war.,None
49838,"Do you feel that we are now heading perhaps, for some kind of nuclear Armageddon?",None
49920,And do you feel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity?,Premise
50014,"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.",Premise
50524,"But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.",Claim
50647,"So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.",Claim
50728,"Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.",Claim
50845,"But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.",Premise
51064,And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.,Premise
51250,"But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.",None
51494,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?",None
51690,Strategic Defense Initiative,Claim
51727,"Mr. President, when you made that proposal, the so-called Star Wars proposal, you said, if I'm not mistaken, that you would share this very super-sophisticated technology with the Soviet Union.",None
51921,"After all of the distrust over the years, sir, that you have expressed towards the Soviet Union, do you really expect anyone to take seriously that offer that you would share the best of America's technology in this weapons area with our principal adversary?",None
52189,Why not?,None
52198,What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?,Premise
52333,"There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.",None
52444,But suppose we came up with that?,Premise
52478,"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''",Premise
52647,But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?,None
52722,"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do.",None
52757,We'll even give it to you.,None
52784,"Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''",Claim
52918,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.,None
52988,"Mr. Mondale, you've been very sharply critical of the President's Strategic Defense Initiative.",None
53084,"And yet, what is wrong with a major effort by this country to try to use its best technology to knock out as many incoming nuclear warheads as possible?",Premise
53247,"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.",Premise
53418,"We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.",Premise
53539,"And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.",None
53684,"And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.",Claim
53787,I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.,None
53850,"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?",Claim
53884,There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.,Premise
53929,"If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.",Premise
54072,"But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.",Claim
54363,It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.,Premise
54440,The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.,Claim
54520,And they always do.,Premise
54540,We don't get behind.,Premise
54561,They won't get behind.,None
54584,And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.,Claim
54635,We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.,Premise
54691,"If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.",None
55119,One final point.,Claim
55136,"The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.",Claim
55277,That's dead wrong.,Premise
55296,There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.,Premise
55393,"It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",None
55505,Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?,Claim
55628,"Mr. Mondale, in this general area, sir, of arms control, President Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, said, ""A nuclear freeze is a hoax.''",Premise
55789,"Yet the basis of your arms proposals, as I understand them, is a mutual and verifiable freeze on existing weapons systems.",None
55912,"In your view, which specific weapons systems could be subject to a mutual and verifiable freeze, and which could not?",Claim
56040,Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.,Premise
56137,I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.,Premise
56281,I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.,None

15637,"So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.",Claim
15688,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.,Claim
15760,"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",None

36960,"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.",Claim

39160,I think everybody knows that.,Claim
39190,I'm also very tough on violent crime.,Claim
39228,And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.,Claim

40161,I don't think most people do.,Claim

40363,"Response, Mr. Vice President.",None
40400,"Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.",Premise

41070,"Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.",Premise

41346,I do not favor abortion.,Claim

42084,"But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.",Claim
42133,And I favor adoption.,Claim

42389,"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",Claim
42432,"And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.",Claim

42595,"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",Premise
42694,"As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.",Claim
42778,"See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.",Claim
42893,We certainly do.,Claim
42910,"But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",Claim
43136,Governor.,None

44417,Certainly the evidence is compelling.,None
44455,There's an explosion of single parent families.,None
44503,"And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control.",None
44701,"If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?",None
44868,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.",None
45010,"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.",Claim
45114,"That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.",None
45173,I do strongly support the WIC program.,Claim
45212,I think it is good.,Claim
45232,"I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.",Claim
45486,"But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.",None
45557,"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.",None
45700,"I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.",Claim
45957,I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.,Claim
46033,And so it's a combination of these things.,Premise

46364,I'm for Head Start and moving that up.,Claim
46403,"And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.",Claim
46472,But I favor that.,Claim
46490,"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",Claim
46717,Governor.,None
46737,"Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.",Premise
47038,It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.,Claim
47182,"And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.",Claim
47254,Let me just give you one other example.,None

48106,"Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president.",None
48185,Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed.,None
48270,"And can you be specific about the programs not only you'd reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you'd begin.",None
48397,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.",Claim
48529,Welfare reform is one way to do it.,Claim
48565,"If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.",Claim
49019,That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,None
49119,"In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.",Claim
49253,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,Claim
49390,Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.,None
49588,"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.",Premise
49934,"So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.",Claim

50111,I know the private sector is.,Claim

312,The importance of tonight's debate is underscored by two facts.,None
376,Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis said their selections of a running mate would reveal a lot about themselves.,None

1154,"Senator, you have been criticized, as we all know, for your decision to stay out of the Vietnam War, for your poor academic record.",None

2469,On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the Governor of Massachusetts.,Claim

2717,You better understand about telemetry and encryption.,Claim

2853,"These are important issues, because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions.",Claim
2944,"In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill, a bill that has trained and employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and adults in this country.",Premise
3157,"On the area of the Federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee.",Claim
3258,And I wish that the Congress would give us the line item veto to help deal with that.,Claim

3501,(Applause),None
3523,Senator Bentsen - I'm going to interrupt at this point and ask once again that the audience please keep your responses as quiet as possible.,None
3664,We know that many of you here are for one candidate or another.,None

3911,So please.,None
3922,"Senator Bentsen, you have one minute to respond.",None
3981,This debate tonight is not about the qualifications for the Vice Presidency.,Claim
4058,The debate is whether or not Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen are qualified to be President of the United States.,Claim
4168,"Because Judy, just as you have said, that has happened too often in the past.",Premise
4246,"And if that tragedy should occur, we have to step in there without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world, that of running this great country of ours; to take over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry that this country has.",Claim
4574,"No, the debate tonight is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you.",Claim
4694,The stakes could not be higher.,Claim
4737,"Senator Bentsen, a question for you, and you also have two minutes to respond.",None

5189,"Well, I am delighted to respond to that question, because we agree on so many things and the vast majority of the issues.",Claim
5311,We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit.,Claim
5366,And Gov.,None
5375,"Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachusetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the United States.",Premise
5583,That is a major sense of achievement.,Claim
5621,And I admire that.,Claim
5640,And I'm just delighted to be on the ticket with him.,Claim
5693,Gov.,None
5698,"Dukakis and I agreed that we ought to have a trade policy for this country; that we've seen this Administration more than double the national debt, that; they've moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their Administration; that they have not had a trade policy; that they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country; that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products.",Claim
6201,"And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way.",Claim
6328,"But we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to their markets.",Claim
6480,"Now, that means that we're going to stand tough for America, and we're going to protect those jobs, and we're going to push American products, and we're going to open up markets around the world.",Claim
6676,"We'll show leadership in that respect, and turn this deficit and trade around.",Claim
6755,That's the sort of thing that Michael Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all our people.,Claim
6878,"Senator Quayle, a minute to respond.",None
6924,"As you notice, Senator Bentsen didn't tell you very much about what Gov.",None
6997,Dukakis would do - Gov.,None

7143,Dukakis is that he's cut taxes.,Claim
7175,"The fact of the matter is, Senator Bentsen, he's raised taxes five times.",Claim
7249,He just raised taxes this past year.,Claim
7286,And that's why a lot of people refer to him as Tax-hike Mike.,Claim
7348,That's why they refer to the State of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts.,Claim
7417,"Because every time there's a problem, the liberal governor from Massachusetts raises taxes.",Premise
7509,I don't blame Senator Bentsen for not talking about Gov.,Claim
7566,Michael Dukakis.,None
7583,He's talking more about his record.,Claim

7786,"Senator Bentsen, you have claimed that Vice President Bush and the Republicans will raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and you have vowed to protect it.",None
7941,"But as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, you must know that there is something to the argument of your fellow Democrat Bob Strauss that some restraint on Social Security growth may be needed, or at least some decision to tax most Social Security benefits as regular income.",None
8223,"In fact, you once voted for and spoke for a six-month delay on cost of living adjustment increases for Social Security.",None
8343,"Senator, aren't you and Gov.",None
8372,"Dukakis using this issue politically, rather than dealing with it responsibly?",None
8461,"Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people on Social Security.",Claim
8595,"And Social Security is an issue where Senator Quayle voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security, where this administration came in and tried to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits, $122 a month for widows, for retirees, tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end run on Social Security when they first came in after promising not to cut it - to cut it by some 20 billion, and while we were working together to reform the Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going to be there for people when they retired.",Claim
9184,At that point they tried a $40-billion end run to cut Social Security.,Claim
9255,"Now, the record is clear.",Claim
9281,And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the west coast to break a tie in the United States Senate.,Claim
9385,"He doesn't get to vote very often in the Senate, but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase.",Claim
9518,"Now, when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program.",Claim
9651,And I think it's very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration.,Claim
9747,"When they talk about the fact that they are going to continue to cut this budget, I know too well what their rack record is.",Premise
9872,And we should be concerned with that kind of an effort once again after the election is over.,Claim
9977,"Senator Quayle, your response?",None
10017,"Senator Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times.",Claim
10108,What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.,Claim
10213,Senator Bentsen two times in the United States Senate voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.,Premise
10314,The governor of Massachusetts at a governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment.,Premise
10434,"And, John, you are right: they use this for political advantage.",Claim
10499,What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country.,Claim
10583,That's the politics of the past.,Claim
10616,In 1983 Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and in a bipartisan effort saved the Social Security system.,None
10742,"Republicans and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program - it's a program for older Americans.",Claim
10913,And that program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century.,Claim
10991,"John, a question for Senator Quayle.",None

40177,"Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger; we've got to get to education.",Claim

41525,It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in Panama.,Claim
41693,"(Shouts and applause) What we have seen under this administration - we have seen them using eight cabinet officers, twenty-eight different agencies, all fighting over turf - and that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration.",Claim
41946,"We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done.",Claim
42062,"Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement Agency said was a model to the country.",Claim
42352,We would be doing that around the rest of the country.,Claim

42757,What would you do next?,None
42781,(Laughter),None

42906,"The situation is that if I was called upon to serve as the president of this country, or the responsibilities of the president of this country, would I be capable and qualified to do that?",None

43789,"Once again I think what we are looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if that tragedy would occur.",Claim
43932,"And if that's the case, again you have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience.",Claim
44051,You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him.,Claim
44163,"And if you do that type of thing, then you arrive at a judgment that I think would be a wise one.",Claim

44386,"Brit, question for Senator Bentsen.",None
44429,"Senator, I want to take you back if I can to the celebrated Breakfast Club, when it was first revealed that you had a plan to have people pay $10,000 a plate to have breakfast with you.",None

45071,"I really must say, Brit, I don't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozy.",Claim
45155,And I agree with that.,Claim
45178,"And, as you know, I immediately disbanded it.",Claim
45224,It was perfectly legal.,Claim
45248,And you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill - and you know that.,None
45318,But I still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation.,Claim
45442,"Even though it's legal, the perception is bad.",Claim
45489,So I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation.,Claim

46021,There's legislation before the Congress to do that.,Claim
46073,"That way, we won't have to worry about breakfast clubs, or who's the number one PAC raiser.",Claim
46165,We can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of America.,Claim
46269,We can also strengthen our two party system - and it needs strengthening - and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past.,Claim

47113,"And specifically as a Texan, could you support a substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels which might be necessary down the road?",None
47261,"Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner.",Claim
47398,"And what Mike Dukakis has said is that he'll try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the northeast, a way, in turn, can fight against acid rain which is another threat, because it's sterilizing our lakes, it's killing our fish.",None

47874,I don't think that that's a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment.,Claim

48358,So absolutely.,Claim
48373,I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one.,Claim
48463,"Because if we don't protect that, we'll destroy the future of our children.",Claim

50372,"When you look at dealing with this total problem - i t's not just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total world debt problem - you have got to see, why are we a debtor, and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today, whether it's Japanese or others.",Claim
50665,"I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere.",Claim
50777,"Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.",Premise

50947,We are the envy of the world.,Claim
50977,The United States - (Laughter),None
51017,Some of Senator Bentsen's supporters laugh at that.,Claim

51486,Forgiveness of debt is wrong.,Claim
51516,Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive.,Claim
51578,"And I would like to see those that talk about forgiving debt, Senator Bentsen, go out and talk about a farmer that's in debt that doesn't have his forgiven.",Premise
51735,That's not the kind of policy George Bush will have.,Claim
51799,Senator Bentsen.,None
51826,"Well, I've told you what I'd do about trade and trying to help turn that situation around.",None
51917,But what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense.,Claim
52022,"We have a situation today where, on a per capita basis, people in Western Europe are spending about one-third as much as we are in our country.",Claim
52166,"And then when you go to Japan, where we're spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending one percent.",Premise

52369,"And I said, you know, we have 50,000 troops here in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia.",None

52498,You're the number two economic power in the world.,None
52549,You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost.,None
52625,"I said, if we were not doing what we're doing, we'd have a big budget surplus.",None
52704,"And I said, you'd have chaos, because you get 55 percent of your oil from the Persian Gulf, and you wouldn't have the U.S. Navy down there to take care of that.",None
52865,"Now, the Senator from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States Senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he votes against that.",Premise

53098,"Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Quayle.",None
53150,"Senator Quayle, I don't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound in it.",None
53231,"But to follow up on Brit Hume's question, when you said that it was a hypothetical situation, it is, sir, after all, the reason that we're here tonight, because you are running not just for Vice President - (Applause)",None
53458,"And if you cite the experience that you had in Congress, surely you must have some plan in mind about what you would do if it fell to you to become President of the United States, as it has to so many Vice Presidents just in the last 25 years or so.",None
53717,Let me try to answer the question one more time.,None
53766,I think this is the fourth time that I've had this question.,None
53836,The third time.,None
53861,"Three times that I've had this question - and I will try to answer it again for you, as clearly as I can, because the question you are asking is what kind of qualifications does Dan Quayle have to be president, what kind of qualifications do I have and what would I do in this kind of a situation.",None
54159,And what would I do in this situation?,None
54198,"I would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in, and I would talk to them, and I will work with them.",Premise
54365,"And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council.",Claim
54479,"And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort.",Claim
54576,"I will know them on a firsthand basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council, and I will be in charge of that.",Premise
54722,I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government.,Claim
54791,"And then, if that unfortunate situation happens - if that situation, which would be very tragic, happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United States of America.",Claim
55001,And I will be prepared to do that.,Claim
55036,"I will be prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead.",Claim
55157,"It is not just age; it's accomplishments, it's experience.",Claim
55216,I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country.,Claim

55691,(Prolonged shouts and applause) What has to be done in a situation like that is to call in the -,None
55799,"Please, please, once again you are only taking time away from your own candidate.",None
55890,"That was really uncalled for, Senator.",None
55929,(Shouts and applause),None
55961,"You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator - and I'm one who knew him well.",Claim
56050,And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.,Claim
56200,"Tom, a question for Senator Bentsen.",None
56246,"Since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage, let me ask you a question - (Laughter) - about the American hostages, nine, still in brutal captivity in the Middle East.",None
56422,"Senator Bentsen, you have been critical of the Iran-contra affair, but tell me, does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the American hostages being held in the Middle East released in any due time?",None
56658,"Tom, that's one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face, because you can't help but have sympathy for that family, and for those hostages in the cells.",Premise
56830,"But the one thing we ought to know by now is that you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah, you can't trade arms for hostages.",Claim
56974,When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages.,Premise
57072,And that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement.,Claim
57165,"And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said - if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd?",Claim
57402,"(Shouts and applause) Because I would be saying: That's a dumb idea, and now let's put an end to it.",Premise
57503,And I would speak up on that type of thing.,Claim
57547,"So all you can do in that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure in addition to that.",None
57712,And that's what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages.,Claim
57807,But not to encourage more taking of hostages.,Claim
57864,Senator Quayle.,None
57889,"There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated - we learn by our mistakes.",Claim
58006,But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration.,Claim
58090,But the question goes to a very difficult one: How do you do it?,None
58155,No one has the answer.,None
58178,"If they did, we would certainly do it.",None
58217,"But we will keep trying, we'll keep the doors open, and hopefully some day Iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community.",Claim
58393,"And they can do that, starting now, by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.",Claim
58493,"Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.",None
58546,"Senator, much of the Dukakis and Bentsen campaign of late has been devoted to the notion that Senator Quayle isn't ready for the vice presidency and perhaps the presidency, and certainly nothing that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise.",None
58808,"I wonder if you think it's really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice-presidency, in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in Washington was about equal to what he has now.",None
59192,"Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country - (Shouts, laughter) - served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in my service there.",Claim
59617,"I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I'm well aware of that.",Claim
59715,But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task.,Claim
59863,That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America.,Claim
59935,"It's a presidential decision that you are facing, and a very important one, because we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future.",Claim
60091,And you can't have a more important responsibility than that one.,Claim
60168,Senator Quayle.,None
60193,"When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience.",Claim
60277,And one of the accomplishments I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged.,Claim
60501,And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas.,Claim
60688,We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders.,Claim
60865,"And what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work.",Claim
60975,"That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.",Claim
61090,"Brit, a question for Senator Quayle.",None
61134,"Senator, I want to ask you a question that may be a little off the subject of politics, but which is aimed to get more at the question of what sort of person you are.",None
61301,"I would hope that, Senator Bentsen, if you choose to, you might choose to answer the same question in your rebuttal time.",None
61423,"Senator, can you identify any work of literature or art or even of film that you have seen or read or experienced in any way in the last two years that has had a particularly strong effect on you, and tell us why.",None
61646,"In the last six months, I think there are three very important books that I read that have had an impact.",None
61752,"The three books are, one, Richard Nixon's Victory in 1999, Richard Lugar's - Senator Richard Lugar's - Letters to the Next President, Bob Massey's Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917.",Premise
62007,"Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact, because what former President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century.",Premise
62253,"And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us.",Claim
62445,"In Senator Lugar's book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda.",Premise
62674,"Former President Nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control, and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the Soviet Union; he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union - and this is one of the differences between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength.",Premise
63108,And the governor of Massachusetts doesn't understand that.,Claim
63167,I understand it.,Claim
63184,And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy.,Claim
63253,Senator Bentsen.,None
63280,"Well, I think reading ""Winds of War"" and ""Guns of August"" back to back - I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again.",Claim
63445,And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one.,Claim
63523,As I look toward our progress that's been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF treaty - and I think he deserves great credit with that one.,Premise
63746,"I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation, when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has done and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and says let's go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty.",Premise
64069,I think that's a mistake.,Claim
64095,"I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage.",Claim
64321,I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much.,Claim
64434,Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there.,Premise
64571,He's listening once again to the winds of the radical right.,Premise

74754,"He's taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it's gone up about the rest of the nation.",Claim

7563,And what I have proposed is something much better.,Claim
7614,And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.,Claim
7732,And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.,Premise
7892,I hear this talk about a blank check.,None
7930,The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.,None
8005,And they know who appropriates the money.,None
8047,It is the United States Congress.,None
8081,"And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",None
8139,And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.,None
8256,So I'm pledged to do that.,None
8283,"And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them",None
8397,Gov.,None
8402,"Dukakis, your one-minute response.",None
8447,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.",Premise
8489,He's broken it three times in the past year already.,Premise
8542,So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.,Claim
8587,"And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.",None
8862,"He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.",Premise
8946,"He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it.",Premise
9094,And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.,Premise
9175,"Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.",Claim
9507,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",Claim
9681,Governor,None
9700,will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.,Claim
9799,(Applause),None
9817,And to Governor Dukakis.,None
9852,"Governor, let me follow up on that by asking you you've said it many times that you have balanced ten budgets in a row in Massachusetts.",None
9989,"Are you promising the American people here tonight that within a four-year presidential term, you will balance the federal budget?",None
10130,"No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.",Claim
10210,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.,Claim
10259,"I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.",Claim
10724,And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.,Premise
10888,Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.,Claim
10949,That's not what we are going to do.,Claim
10985,I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.,Premise
11022,"But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.",Claim
11236,"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.",Claim
11718,"We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.",Claim
11846,"Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.",Claim
12026,But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.,Claim
12094,"And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.",Premise
12379,"Mr. Vice President, your response.",None
12421,The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.,Premise
12499,He has raised taxes several times.,Premise

12705,"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.",Premise
12827,And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.,Claim
13014,I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.,Claim
13057,(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.,Premise
13154,I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.,None
13209,"And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.",Premise
13434,(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.,Claim
13478,(Boos and applause),None
13505,I'm going to say this and I'm going to say it once to every person in this auditorium: what these candidates are about is of utmost seriousness to the American voters; they should be heard and you should be quiet.,Premise

13982,"Governor, you won the first debate on intellect, and yet you lost it on heart.",None
14068,Just a minute.,None
14092,You'll get your turn.,None
14124,I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.,None
14186,"The American public admired your performance, but didn't seem to like you much.",Claim
14266,"Now, Ronald Reagan has found his personal warmth to be a tremendous political asset.",Premise
14351,Do you think that a president has to be likable to be an effective leader?,None
14436,"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.",Claim
14595,"As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.",Premise
14723,"(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.",Premise
14881,I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.,Premise
14945,I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.,Claim
14983,"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.",Claim
15151,But I'm also a serious guy.,Claim
15179,"I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.",Claim
15316,So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.,None
15488,(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.,Claim
15590,"Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.",Claim
15689,"I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.",Premise
15805,"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.",Premise
15896,"So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.",Claim
16013,"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.",Premise
16350,"And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people.",Claim
16455,"But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.",Claim
16674,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",Premise
16802,One minute from the Vice President.,None
16845,I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.,Claim
16942,"I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin.",Claim
17453,You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.,Premise
17572,You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.,Claim
17774,"It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.",Premise

18876,"And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.",Claim
18983,"And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.",Premise
19130,"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.",Premise
19259,And in the process the negatives began.,Premise

20017,Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.,Premise
20088,I support that.,Claim

42631,"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.",Premise

44179,I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.,Premise
44234,"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.",Premise
44348,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.,Claim

47428,"But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.",Claim

5734,"There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.",Claim

7175,I disagree with both of them.,Claim
7205,"For one thing, let me just follow up here.",None
7248,I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.,Claim
7430,His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.,Premise
7536,"And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.",Premise
7650,"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.",Premise
7751,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.,Premise

8466,The tax burden on them has not gone down.,Claim
8508,It has gone up.,Claim
8524,"I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.",Claim
8658,The answer is to invest and grow this economy.,Claim
8705,That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.,Premise

9695,"They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.",Premise
9756,We don't want to go back to that.,Claim

9940,"Mr. President, when you said just then that you admit your mistakes and you looked at Governor Clinton and said -- what mistake is it that you want him to admit to?",None
10112,"Well, the record in Arkansas.",Premise
10142,"I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?",None
10208,"Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.",Premise
10251,They are.,None

10756,"It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.",None

10922,What's his mistake?,None
10942,"Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.",Claim
11084,"Governor, is that true?",None
11118,"Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.",Premise

12162,It's a fairly rural state.,Premise
12189,"It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.",Premise

12427,Why is that a mistake?,None
12458,It's irrelevant.,Premise
12475,(Laughter),None
12496,What he did as governor of Arkansas is irrelevant?,None
12555,"No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.",Premise

12814,Governor?,None
12834,"Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.",Premise
13420,"And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.",None

13605,It's not --,None
13627,And the people who have jobs -- (APPLAUSE)  The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.,Claim
13888,"I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.",None
13964,"Well, you think it's relevant.",None

14014,"Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.",None
14117,"I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.",None
14372,And we almost had it done.,Claim
14399,"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!""",None

14996,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.",None

15257,"Mr. President, let's move to some of the leadership concerns that have been voiced about you.",None
15351,And they relate to something you said in your closing statement in Richmond the other night about the president being the manager of crises.,None
15492,"And that relates to an earlier criticism, that you began to focus on the economy, on health care, on racial divisions in this country, only after they became crises.",None

15692,"Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.",Claim
15731,I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.,Premise

16435,"And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.",Claim
16582,"And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.",Premise
16728,And that is good.,Claim
16747,"I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.",Claim
16890,What was the other part of it?,None
16931,"Well, it's just that -- you've spoken to it.",None
16976,"I mean, but the idea, not so much in specifics, but that it has to be a crisis before it gets your attention.",None
17093,I don't think that's true at all.,Claim
17127,"I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.",Claim
17205,"Do you think that's true, Mr. Perot?",None
17250,"I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --",None
17305,You don't think this is an issue?,None
17347,"Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.",None
17401,"See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?",None
17462,And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.,None
17553,"Well, then, let's phrase -- I'll phrase it differently, then.",None
17615,He said the other night in his closing words in Richmond that one of the key things that he believes the American people should decide between -- among the 3 of you is who they want in charge if this country gets to a crisis.,None
17841,"Now, that's what he said, and the rap on the president is that it's only crisis time that he focuses on some of these things.",None
17967,So my question to you -- we're going to talk about you in a minute --  (Laughter)  -- my question to you --,None
18084,I thought you'd forgotten I was here.,None
18131,"No, no, no, no, no.",None
18151,"(Laughter)  But my question to you is, so -- if you have nothing to say about it, fine, I'll go to Governor Clinton, but --",None
18284,I will let the American people decide that.,None
18328,I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.,None
18383,All right.,None
18394,"Governor, what do you think?",None
18433,"The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.",Premise
18657,"He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.",Claim
18832,"I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.",Claim

21035,"Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning and we've been talking about, which is leadership, as president of the US, it concerns -- my reading of it, at least, my concerns about you, as expressed by folks in the polls and other places, it goes like this.",None
21314,You had a problem with General Motors.,None
21353,You took your $750 million and you left.,None
21394,You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for president of the US and you walked out.,None
21546,Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as president of the US?,None
21637,I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.,Claim

22687,They went their way.,None
22708,I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.,None

24980,"I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.",Claim
25239,"And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.",Claim
25402,"Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.",None

25620,"We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.",Claim
25906,We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.,Claim
25985,So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.,Claim

26216,That's one of the things I want to change.,Claim

26711,"As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.",None
26775,"I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.",None

26968,"And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.",None
27025,I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.,None
27076,"But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.",Claim
27233,There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.,Premise
27388,You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.,Claim
27499,So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.,None
27582,"Governor, what about that charge?",None
27616,Do you want it both ways on this issue?,None
27666,Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.,None
27748,They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.,None

66563,"Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.",None

67691,And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.,Claim
67790,It was a remarkable event.,Claim
67817,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.,Claim

68601,So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.,None
68868,"Mr. President, you have a moment -- a minute, I'm sorry.",None
68932,"Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.",Claim

69502,"And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.",Claim
69672,And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.,Claim
69833,"And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.",Premise
69886,"Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.",None

71477,"Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.",Claim
71538,The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.,Claim

71771,"We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.",Claim
72045,We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.,Claim
72201,And that will be my policy.,Claim

85982,What can you do in 2 weeks to win reelection?,Claim
86035,"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.",Claim

86297,It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.,Premise
86368,"We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.",Claim

86743,"On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.",Premise

87404,The buck stops there.,Premise

87519,"It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.",Claim
87654,So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.,Premise
87723,"And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.",Claim

88001,I got to watch the clock here.,Claim
88032,I don't think we're a declining nation.,Claim

88797,"I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.",Claim
88914,"So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.",Claim
88959,"And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.",Claim

1408,And I think the first question is over here.,None
1473,Yes.,None
1478,I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot.,None
1523,What will you do as president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the US?,None
1737,That's right at the top of my agenda.,None
1775,"We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.",Premise
2095,"Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.",Claim
2327,"And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.",Premise
2559,We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.,Claim
2603,To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.,None
2675,"If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time.",Premise
2883,You've got a mature workforce.,None
2914,"Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.",Premise
3028,"Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.",Premise
3101,And you don't care about anything but making money.,Claim
3153,There will be a job-sucking sound going south.,Claim
3201,If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.,Premise
3331,One last point here.,None
3352,"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long.",None
3558,I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.,None
3596,"And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?",None
3649,"And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.",Claim
3852,We got to cut it out.,Premise
3885,"Thank you, Mr. Perot.",None
3907,"I see that the president has stood up, so he must have something to say about this.",None
3998,"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.",Claim
4136,"And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.",Premise
4273,"And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.",Claim
4570,"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.",Claim
4621,"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.",Claim
4678,And the way to do that is to increase our exports.,Premise
4729,Some believe in protection.,Premise
4757,"I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.",Claim
4836,"So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.",Premise
5023,I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.,Premise
5111,I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.,Premise
5180,"And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.",Claim
5236,"And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.",Claim
5356,Governor Clinton.,None
5384,"I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.",Premise
5643,The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.,Claim
5732,"It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.",Premise
5920,So what is the answer?,None
5943,Let me just mention three things very quickly.,None
5990,"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.",Claim
6185,"Number two, change the tax code.",Claim
6218,There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.,Premise
6362,Our competitors don't do that.,Premise
6393,"Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.",Premise
6484,"Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.",Claim
6723,So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.,Claim
6802,Thank you.,None
6813,I think we have a question over here.,None
6871,This is for Governor Clinton.,None
6901,"In the real world, that is, outside of Washington, DC, compensation and achievement are based on goals defined and achieved.",None
7026,My question is about the deficit.,None
7060,"Would you define in specific dollar goals how much you would reduce the deficit in each of the 4 years of a Clinton administration and then enter into a legally binding contract with the American people, that if you did not achieve those goals that you would not seek a 2nd term?",None
7340,"Answer yes or no and then comment on your answer, please.",None
7408,"No, and here's why.",None
7428,And I'll tell you exactly why.,None
7459,Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.,Premise
7518,I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.,None
7566,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.,Claim
7635,"Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.",Premise
7841,"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.",None
8028,"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",None
8347,"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.",Premise
8546,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,Claim
8599,"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",Claim
8723,"Let me also say, we're having an election today.",None
8772,You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.,None
8920,Mr. President.,None
8942,"Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.",Claim
9057,"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.",Claim
9122,I think they're taxed too much.,Claim
9154,I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.,Premise
9220,I said that wasn't the right thing to do.,Premise
9262,"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.",Claim
9372,I don't believe that's the way to do it.,Claim
9414,Here's some thing that'll help.,None
9446,Give us a balanced budget amendment.,None
9483,"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.",None
9592,Have to do it.,None
9607,I'd like the government to have that.,None
9645,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.",Claim
9748,"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.",Premise
9993,I've proposed another one.,Premise
10020,Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.,Claim
10074,I think it's good.,Claim
10093,It's a check- off.,None
10112,It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.,None
10202,"You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.",Premise
10411,"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.",Premise
10547,You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.,Premise
10625,"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.",Claim
10708,"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.",Claim
10814,That's the main growing thing in the budget.,Premise
10859,"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",Claim
10976,"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.",Claim
11095,I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.,Claim
11175,"How about you, Mr. Perot?",None
11209,"Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.",Claim
11242,"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.",Premise
11349,"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.",None
11407,"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.",None
11474,This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.,None
11539,The American people asked me to get into it.,Claim
11584,But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.,Premise
11717,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.",Claim
11801,And what I'm looking for is who did it?,None
11841,"Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.",None
11924,"Now, the facts are we have to fix it.",Premise

12384,Now that's up to 40%.,None
12406,And what's happened in the meantime?,None

13466,"We have one up here, I think.",None
13516,"Yes, I'd like to address all the candidates with this question.",None
13580,The amount of time the candidates have spent in this campaign trashing their opponents' character and their programs is depressingly large.,None

13905,Who wants to take that one?,None
13933,"Mr. Perot, you have an answer for everything, don't you?",None

37176,"Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.",Claim
37335,And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.,Premise
37618,That's where we are.,Claim

12990,And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.,Premise

13301,Senator Dole.,None

50212,"I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.",Claim

56690,Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.,Claim
56742,"For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.",Claim

58550,I'm for it.,None
58562,"Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.",Premise
58700,Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.,Premise

60885,Let me just give you one tiny example.,Premise
60924,"In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.",Claim

61321,That's just one tiny example.,None
61351,Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.,None
61413,Next question's for Senator Dole this section.,None
61460,"Yes, ma'am.",None
61472,Yes.,None
61489,"Senator Dole, I am Bertha Strategos, and I work in health care and it's truly an honor to be here tonight to address both of you.",None
61626,Thank you.,None
61649,"Being in health care -- we have talked about a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly Medi-Cal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem.",None
61825,"Managed care is taking over, especially in California.",None
61880,"And because of that, the quality of care is going downhill.",None
61940,"There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them, and because of that, they are dying needlessly.",None
62077,"There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this.",None
62179,And I think it's a real problem that needs to be addressed.,None
62239,What would you do if you were president?,Claim
62287,"Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.",Premise
62541,Everybody would have been forced into managed care.,Premise
62593,You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.,Claim
62668,And I think right now we got to go back.,Claim
62709,I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.,None
62779,Maybe that's part of the answer.,None
62812,"But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.",Premise
63118,We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.,Premise
63209,That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.,Claim
63347,Didn't get it done.,None
63367,"And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.",Premise
63447,"It was a big, big mistake.",Claim
63474,"Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.",None
63651,I hope not.,None
63663,I hope not in both cases.,Premise
63689,But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.,Premise
63782,You're going to have to watch it.,Claim
63816,"Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.",Claim
63973,I'm just curious.,None
63991,How many of you are under managed care plans?,None
64037,Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.,None
64085,How many of you like it?,None
64117,Two.,Claim
64132,"Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.",Claim
64365,Now that's not a government takeover.,Premise
64403,That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.,Claim
64492,I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.,None
64570,"In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.",Claim
64765,"If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.",Claim
64839,"If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.",Premise
64911,"A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.",Premise
65174,Senator Dole.,None
65195,"Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.",None
65237,I think that would help.,Claim
65262,But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.,Premise
65404,"If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.",Claim
65456,"17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.",Premise
65508,We'd have that trouble all over America.,Premise
65549,We need to deal with managed care.,Claim
65584,It not only happened in California.,Claim
65620,"It's happening in other states that we visit, too.",Claim
65671,It's a national problem.,Claim
65696,Not just a state problem.,None
65731,The next question is for President Clinton in this section.,None
65791,"Yes, ma'am.",None
65803,Yes.,None
65819,I would sort of like -- Colleen O'Connor.,None
65861,I teach history and political science in San Diego Mesa College right up the road here.,None
65949,And I would like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that aren't here tonight.,None
66076,"63 percent of the American people are not participating that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process.",None
66198,"Several parties can't even get in the debate; the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party, all of these people are basically opted out of what we're still participating in.",None
66384,"If we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the president can do to begin that process to bring them back in?",None
66608,"First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.",Claim
66677,That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.,Claim
66730,There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.,Claim
66841,"Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.",Claim
66916,You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.,Premise
66986,A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.,None
67062,"Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.",Claim
67198,"Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.",Premise
67395,"And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.",Premise
67504,"For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.",Claim
67665,So I think we have to change the nature of politics.,None
67718,"The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.",Claim
68257,Those are my best ideas about it.,None
68298,"Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.",Premise
68342,"I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.",Claim
68426,"And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.",Premise
68481,"People say, ""I don't care.",Premise
68508,"One vote doesn't make a difference.""",Premise
68545,I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.,Claim
68644,I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.,Premise
68707,Campaign finance might help.,Premise
68736,"It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.",Premise
68928,But maybe there ought to be more debates.,None
68970,I would be willing to have another debate this year.,None
69023,We can invite all the candidates.,None
69057,And talk about the economy.,Premise
69085,"If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.",Premise
69281,If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.,Claim
69340,It's going to help jobs.,Claim
69365,It's going to help everything.,None
69406,"Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.",Premise
69498,One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.,Claim
69663,And there is a connection.,Claim
69690,"And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.",Claim
69886,If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.,Claim
69950,"If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.",Premise
70007,But these are important questions.,Premise
70042,And people have to decide.,Claim
70069,I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.,None
70245,"For Senator Dole, in this section, on the back row.",None
70297,"Yes, ma'am.",None
70319,I'm Iris Siefert and I'm unemployed.,None
70363,Iris.,None
70363,Iris.,None
70385,"Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers.",None
70452,But shouldn't we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well?,Claim
70525,Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the government and on Social Security when we retire?,Premise
70683,"Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.",None
70795,You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.,Claim
70873,"We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.",Premise
71017,Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.,Premise
71115,You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.,None
71223,It's something you might consider.,None
71258,"I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.",Premise
71331,"It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.",Premise
71596,And we didn't touch it.,Claim
71620,We preserved it.,Claim
71637,And I'm an optimist.,Claim
71658,Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.,Claim
71722,We will fix it.,Premise
71738,It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.,Premise
71788,In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.,None
71830,It didn't work.,Premise
71846,"Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.",Claim
71956,So we need to preserve the system.,Claim
71991,And we need to make it stronger.,None
72024,"But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.",Premise
72122,"In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.",Claim
72283,"so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.",Premise
72360,"Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.",Claim
72417,Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.,Claim
72480,"And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.",Premise
72633,"So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.",Claim
72849,"So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.",Premise
73196,"In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.",Claim
73424,My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.,None
73604,Now none of that will happen anymore.,Claim
73642,"I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.",None
73801,Did you say you're unemployed?,Claim
73842,Yes.,Premise
73854,"See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.",Claim
73907,And that's the economic package again.,Claim
73946,Create jobs and opportunities.,Claim
73977,Reduce the capital gains rate.,Claim
74008,Reduce regulatory reform.,Claim
74034,Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.,None
74105,And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.,Claim
74156,"Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.",Premise
74249,"Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.",Premise
74297,We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.,Premise
74419,We took it out of politics.,Claim
74447,people get so tired of politics.,None
74480,We ought to do the same with Medicare.,None
74519,Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.,None
74567,All right.,None
74578,The question's is for President Clinton.,None
74619,Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section?,None
74681,"Yes, sir.",None
74699,Good evening.,None

74732,I'm an electronics technician in the Navy.,None
74775,My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan.,Premise
74857,Let me tell you what we have done.,Claim
74892,We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.,Premise
74967,"And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.",Premise
75158,Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.,Claim
75232,"It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.",Claim
75333,But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.,Premise
75417,We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.,Premise
75481,I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.,Premise
75523,"I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.",Claim

9673,"They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.",None
9734,"And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.",Claim
10018,That's what I've been critical about the administration for.,Claim

16001,The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.,Claim

18602,How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?,None
18748,Excellent question.,Claim
18768,And here is the simple difference.,Claim
18803,"My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.",Premise
18880,"And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.",Premise
19004,"Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.",Claim

19385,And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.,Premise
19435,"And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.",Premise

19877,There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.,Claim
19923,"Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.",Premise

23022,How would you draw the difference?,Claim
23064,Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.,Claim

10352,We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief.,Claim
10453,We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II.,Claim
10525,"The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes.",Premise
10608,"We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills.",Claim
10805,It is their choice and it is their prerogative.,None
10853,We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.,Claim
10995,Senator?,None
11016,Let me start with the numbers.,None
11047,"With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee.",None
11228,We're using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.,None
11310,We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security.,None
11437,That's where the agreement ends.,None
11470,"We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says ""politicians keep your hands off.""",Claim
11639,Our opponents do not do that.,None
11669,"In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut.",Claim
11832,Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about.,None
11907,"The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%.",Premise
12032,"Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they're $1.1 trillion in debt.",Premise
12240,"That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family.",Claim
12383,"Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions.",Premise
12516,"So if we've learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible.",Claim
12723,And that's why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year.,Claim
12802,"In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent's economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt.",Claim
12957,Time.,None
12963,The next question goes to you.,None
12994,"Gentlemen, this is the 21st Century.",None
13031,Yet on average an American working woman in our great nation earns 75 cents for each $1 earned by a working male.,None
13145,What do you males propose to do about it?,None
13199,It's a good and important question.,None
13235,"Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied.",Premise
13373,"Bernie, your question is absolutely right.",None
13416,Women -- actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job.,Premise
13519,Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we've stated specific goals for the future.,Premise
13615,And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women.,Claim
13689,It's unfair and it's unacceptable.,Premise
13724,And the first way we will do that is by supporting the Equal Pay Act which has been proposed in Congress which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally.,Claim
13959,"Secondly, we're going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves.",Claim
14212,And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here.,Claim
14303,"So bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation.",Premise
14365,"And even though, as the economy has risen in the last eight years, America's women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they're doing as a man receives, we've not achieved genuine equality in this country.",Premise
14645,Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality.,Claim
14722,In so many families women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner.,Premise
14805,"So this cause affects not only the women, but families and the children as well.",Premise
14893,Mr. Secretary.,None
14917,I share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someone's gender.,Premise
15013,"We have made progress in recent years, but I think we have a ways to go.",Premise
15086,It's not just about the differential with respect to women.,Premise
15146,"If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home.",Premise
15372,"You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal.",None
15493,It provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes.,Claim
15557,"It's important to understand the things we're trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation.",Premise
15946,We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it.,None
16092,"The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that.",Claim
16155,It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits.,Claim
16207,"If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief.",Claim
16370,"Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief.",Premise
16575,Might I have an opportunity to respond?,None
16622,You can respond senator.,None
16647,But I caution you gentlemen if you do this consistently we won't cover a lot of topics.,None
16735,"After the Senator responds, you don't have to feel compelled to respond to the Senator.",None
16832,Depends on what he says.,None
16869,This is an important difference between us.,None
16913,I want to clarify it briefly if I can.,None
16952,"The first thing is the tax relief program that we've proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society.",Claim
17202,We want you to have that tax credit.,Premise
17239,"Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong.",Claim
17344,It's an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it's just plain wrong.,None
17435,"And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don't get what the governor said they would in the tax program.",Claim
17763,Al Gore and I want to live within our means.,Premise
17808,We're not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the 1% of the public that doesn't need it now.,Claim
17931,We're focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it.,Claim
18018,"Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that don't have health insurance from their employers.",Premise
18165,The tax deduction I talked about earlier.,None
18207,"Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition.",None
18290,"A $3,000 tax credit for the cost -- well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I'll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year.",None
18708,"Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account.",Claim
18832,"By the time they retire, they'll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund.",Premise
18955,"Now, that's --",None
18977,"Your time is up, Senator.",None
19012,You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said.,None
19066,The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for.,Claim
19204,"It's a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves.",Premise
19417,It is a big difference between us.,None
19452,"They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.",Claim
19515,"Mr. Secretary, this question is for you.",None
19556,Would you support the effort of House Republicans who want legislation to restrict distribution of the abortion drug RU-486?,None
19690,"The abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one.",None
19774,"Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that's what we believe.",None
19877,We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society.,Claim
19937,Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing.,Premise
19991,Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible.,Premise
20073,"With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that -- of course, that it's recently been approved by the FDA.",Claim
20188,That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women.,Claim
20266,They didn't address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.,None
20425,What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion.,None
20616,Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative.,None
20669,Encouraging parental notification.,None
20704,And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement.,Claim
20822,"Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions.",Premise
20958,Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore.,Premise
21010,We would hope eventually they would recognize that's not a good position for them to be in.,Claim
21102,"With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven't looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation.",None
21225,"Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion.",Claim
21517,It's a very important question and one on which these two tickets have dramatically different points of view.,None
21627,"My answer is no, I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486.",Claim
21778,"The administration, FDA worked 12 years on this serious problem.",Premise
21843,They made a judgment based on what was good for women's health.,Premise
21907,A doctor has to pescribe and care for a woman using it.,None
21963,I think it's a decision we ought to let stand because it was made by experts.,Claim
22041,But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman's right to choose.,Claim
22196,Our opponents will not.,Claim
22220,"We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God.",Claim
22379,"Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.",Claim
22534,"And, therefore, the number of abortions.",Claim
22575,"Incidentally, here there is good news to report.",None
22624,The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years.,Claim
22703,"In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20%.",Premise
22789,"And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence.",Claim
22962,"But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful.",Claim
23051,"I supported, in fact, a bill in the Senate that would have prohibited late-term abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved.",Premise
23210,I did not support the so-called partial birth abortion bill because it would have prohibited that form of abortion at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman.,Premise
23417,That's unacceptable.,None
23445,"This question is for you, Senator.",None
23480,"If Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic prevails, notwithstanding the election results, would you support his overthrow?",None
23608,"Well, there's good news from Belgrade today, Bernie, as you know.",None
23674,It's unconfirmed.,None
23692,The encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that Mr. Kostunica is the president-elect.,Claim
23799,There are some press reports that are unconfirmed that say that Milosevic has actually left Belgrade.,Claim
23901,That is a very happy ending to a terrible story.,Premise
23950,It's the end of a reign of terror.,Claim
23985,"If that is not confirmed and does not happen, then I think the United States, with its European allies, ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of Serbia to do exactly what they've been doing over the last few days to rise up and end this reign of terror by Milosevic, and bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the United States and others.",Claim
24382,"You know, I'm very proud on this night as it appears that Milosevic is about to or has fallen, of the leadership role the United States played in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo.",Claim
24597,I know our opponents have said they thought it was overreaching.,Premise
24662,It wasn't.,None
24673,It was a matter of principle in America's national interest and values.,Claim
24745,"The fact is that we stopped the aggression, we stopped the genocide, and therefore strengthened our relationship with our European allies in NATO.",Claim
24892,"And, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies.",Premise
25002,"I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate purposive role in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans.",Claim
25218,And hopefully tonight we're seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.,Premise
25309,Secretary Cheney.,None
25336,"I noted, Bernie, like Joe, I'm pleased to see what happened in Yugoslavia today.",None
25417,I hope it marks the end of Milosevic.,Premise
25455,I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people.,Claim
25535,"They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote.",Premise
25615,In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia.,Claim
25755,"We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom.",Premise
25902,And I think we all admire that.,Claim
25934,"I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure.",Claim
26077,"Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops.",Premise
26143,I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved.,Claim
26244,"I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians.",Premise
26448,"It's now clear from the press that, in fact, that's exactly what they were doing.",Premise
26530,It's -- Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.,Claim
26606,He has supported the administration on Kosovo.,Claim
26653,"He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out.",Premise
26819,He's been supportive of the policy that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia.,Claim
26898,And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.,Claim
26948,I would go beyond that.,None
26972,I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia.,Claim
27060,That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he's committed to democracy.,Premise
27147,Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe.,Premise
27274,And it's a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.,Claim
27355,One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.,Claim
27552,"Your question, Mr. Secretary.",None
27582,You and Governor Bush charge the Clinton-Gore administration have presided over the deterioration and overextension of America's armed forces.,None
27725,Should U.S. military personnel be deployed as warriors or peacekeepers?,None
27806,My preference is to deploy them as warriors.,Claim
27851,"There may be occasion when it's appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it.",Premise
28011,The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars.,Claim
28078,And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.,Claim
28207,"I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility.",Claim
28300,We've seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War.,Premise
28404,At the same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.,Premise
28527,There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems.,Premise
28658,"For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously.",Premise
28827,We're overcommitted and underresourced.,Claim
28867,This has had some other unfortunate effects.,Claim
28912,"I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in '95 getting ready to get out of the service because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.",Premise
29203,He's concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost.,Claim
29284,"That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area.",Premise
29345,The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago.,Claim
29425,"Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership.",Claim
29660,"Senator, you're shaking your head in disagreement.",None
29723,I am.,None
29729,"I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world.",Claim
29863,And that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way.,Claim
29935,"It's not right, and it's not good for our military, to run them down essentially in the midst of a partisan political debate.",Premise
30061,The fact is that you've got to judge the military by what the military leaders say.,Premise
30145,"Secretary Bill Cohen, a good republican, and Gen. Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will both tell you the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today.",Premise
30347,"The fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo, to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in a box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly.",Claim
30575,"This administration has turned around the drop in spending that began in the mid-'80's and right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration, but now that's stopped.",Claim
30786,We passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military.,Claim
30855,"And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, the reality is if you look at our projected budgets for the next ten years, Al Gore and I actually commit twice as much, $100 billion in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does.",Claim
31143,And their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems.,Claim
31226,"That's something the same Gen. Mike Ryan of the airforce and all the other chiefs of the services will not be happy about because they need the new equipment, the new systems that Al Gore and I are committed to giving them.",Claim
31459,"Bernie, this is a special interest of mine.",None
31503,"I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might.",None
31559,The facts are dramatically different.,None
31597,"I'm not attacking the military, Joe.",Premise
31634,I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military.,Claim
31701,I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense.,Premise
31793,No one has a higher regard than I do for them.,Claim

32047,"If you look at the data that's available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready.",Claim
32139,The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%.,Premise
32208,Significant problems of retention.,Premise
32243,The important thing for us to remember is that we're a democracy and we're defended by volunteers.,Claim
32342,"Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform.",Claim
32493,"When we don't give them the spare parts they need, when we don't give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we don't give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and let's them know why they're putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale.",Premise
32809,That's an extraordinarily valuable trust.,Premise
32851,"There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war.",Claim
33084,"When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that's old and broken down, we put their lives at risk.",Premise
33246,We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now.,Claim
33356,"With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and it's available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other -- other indicators.",Premise
33677,"Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because we're running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years.",Premise
33826,"As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced.",Premise
33877,We've taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures.,Claim
33952,We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military.,Claim
34027,It's important to respond to this.,None
34062,"Yes, of course it's an important debate to have as part of this campaign, but I don't want either the military to feel uneasy or the American people to feel insecure.",Premise
34229,"What I'm saying now I'm basing on serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff.",None
34414,I've visited our fighting forces around the world.,None
34465,I'm telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise.,Claim

34664,"In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission.",Premise
34905,"In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare.",Claim
35173,"The fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment; helicopters, submarines, tactical air fighters, all the rest.",Premise
35398,That would really cripple our readiness.,Premise
35439,Exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about.,Claim
35496,"Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military.",Claim
35591,"There's still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world.",Claim

19072,"Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.",Claim
19142,"But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.",None

22130,I do.,Premise

22516,"The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.",Claim

24513,"So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?",None

40540,I think these crimes are different.,Premise

55857,Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?,None

57227,"I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.",Claim
57326,And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.,None
57533,"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",Claim

60010,It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.,Claim
60072,"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.",Premise
60248,"And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.",Claim
60597,I think that's the very best way to go.,Premise

61158,"I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.",None
61325,"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.",Claim
61549,So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.,None
61602,But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.,Premise
61768,I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.,None
61865,So it's one of my top priorities.,Claim
61899,"Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.",Claim
61952,"And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.",Premise

62998,It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.,Claim
63074,But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.,Premise
63157,"And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.",Premise
63272,"We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.",Premise
63332,"For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.",Claim

63693,Is he right?,Premise
63713,"Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.",None
64080,"And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.",Premise
64320,"And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.",None
64424,"He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.",Premise
64568,There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.,None
64620,There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.,Premise
64791,I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.,None
64875,"600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.",None

65136,Are those numbers correct?,None
65163,Are his charges correct?,Claim
65195,"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.",None

65383,And they get health care.,Claim
65409,"Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.",Premise
65473,"But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.",Premise
65568,"He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.",None
65693,"And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.",None
65928,Let me just tell you who the jury is.,Premise
65966,The people of Texas.,Premise
65987,"There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.",Claim

67042,"And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?",None
67488,I would.,Premise
67497,"Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.",None
67547,"Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.",None

63436,I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.,Claim

73853,It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.,Claim
73892,It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.,Claim
73940,"It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",Claim
74059,It's a big mistake to do that.,Claim

74430,Did you misjudge him or are you -- do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK?,Claim
74580,"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.",Claim
74629,"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.",Premise

75475,"I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.",None

78505,It was a threat.,None
78522,That's not the issue.,None

6701,And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection.,Claim
6778,There is not.,Claim
6793,And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best.,Premise

7122,"And this time to you, Senator Edwards.",None

7251,Does that mean that if you had been president and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power?,None
7372,Here's what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted.,Claim
7448,John Kerry and I have consistently said that.,Premise
7494,That's why we voted for the resolution.,Claim
7534,But it also means it needed to be done the right way.,Claim
7588,"And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th.",Premise
7900,"Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do.",Premise
7987,That was the right decision.,Premise

8412,"They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam -- I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden.",Claim
8591,Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden.,Claim
8680,We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq.,Claim
8840,And these connections -- I want the American people to hear this very clearly.,None
8919,Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying.,None
8974,Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period.,Claim
9074,The 9/11 Commission has said that's true.,Premise
9116,Colin Powell has said it's true.,Premise

9351,The senator has got his facts wrong.,Premise
9388,"I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there's clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror.",Claim
9520,"And the point is that that's the place where you're most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years.",Premise
9738,"Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror.",Claim
9867,They've got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America.,Claim
9957,We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States.,Premise
10123,That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval.,Premise

10373,"In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm.",Premise
10414,It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.,Claim
10504,A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues.,None
10670,"And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn't again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida.",Claim
10977,"You will respond to that topic, but first I want to ask you for two minutes, Vice President Cheney.",None

11452,We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan.,Claim
11565,"We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him.",Claim
11657,"The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we've done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization.",Premise

12687,We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security.,Claim
12787,"We'll keep U.S. forces there -- we have about 16,000 there today -- as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation.",Claim

13376,"Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds.",None
13424,Someone did get it wrong.,Claim
13450,But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards.,Claim
13493,They got it wrong.,Claim
13512,"When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords.",Premise
13592,"They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large.",Claim
13752,"Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing.",None
13873,He said that -- made mention of this global test.,None
13923,"What John Kerry said -- and it's just as clear as day to anybody who was listening -- he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first.",Claim
14128,We will keep this country safe.,Claim
14160,"He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States.",Claim
14265,He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America.,Claim
14390,"Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasn't said, and the president would too.",None
14490,But the reality is it was said.,None
14523,"Here's what's actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq.",None
14665,What's actually happened is they're now providing 75 percent of the world's opium.,Claim
14749,"Not only are they providing 75 percent of the world's opium, large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords.",Claim
14891,Big parts of the country are still insecure.,Claim
14937,"And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen.",Claim
15106,"Mr. Vice President, 30 seconds.",None

15329,I was there as an observer on behalf of the Congress.,None
15383,"The human drive for freedom, the determination of these people to vote, was unbelievable.",Premise
15473,"And the terrorists would come in and shoot up polling places; as soon as they left, the voters would come back and get in line and would not be denied the right to vote.",Claim
15644,And today El Salvador is a whale of a lot better because we held free elections.,Claim
15726,The power of that concept is enormous.,Claim
15765,"And it will apply in Afghanistan, and it will apply as well in Iraq.",Claim
15845,The vice president just said that we should focus on state sponsors of terrorism.,Premise
15927,Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program.,Premise

17957,"Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible.",Premise
18144,"It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we're doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world -- of other countries.",Premise

18677,"You know, we've taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties.",Premise
18739,American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq.,Claim

19200,"Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong.",Claim
19254,"When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they've taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent.",Claim
19479,"With respect to the cost, it wasn't $200 billion.",Claim
19529,You probably weren't there to vote for that.,None
19574,"But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq.",Claim

6377,"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.",Claim
6486,"The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?",Premise
6599,"Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.",Premise
6834,"Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.",Premise
7031,"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.",Claim
7148,And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.,Claim
7217,"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?",Premise
7306,We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.,Claim
7389,And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.,Premise

8608,"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.",Premise
8705,"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",None

11128,"And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.",Premise

12706,"You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.",Premise
12774,"I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.",Claim
12901,And it has got to be brought under control.,Claim

13718,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",Premise
13935,"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",Premise

25246,China had a space launch and a space walk.,Premise
25289,We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.,Claim

25675,"Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.",Claim

26944,"We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.",Premise
27110,So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.,Claim

27387,I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.,Premise
27515,"And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.",Premise

27909,But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout?,None

28437,Not willing to give that up?,None
28474,Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.,Claim

28612,We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.,Claim
28713,Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.,Claim
28767,They just skim off $15 billion.,Premise
28799,That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.,Premise
28902,They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.,Premise
28988,Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.,Premise
29038,"Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.",Claim

29991,"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.",None
30097,Spending freeze?,None
30123,I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.,Claim
30267,Would you go for that?,None
30298,The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.,Premise
30385,There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.,Claim
30456,"I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.",Premise

31772,Before we go to another lead question.,None
31811,Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here.,None

32236,There is no doubt about it.,Claim
32264,"Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.",Premise
32588,"If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.",Claim
32736,"And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.",Claim
32909,"The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.",Claim
33408,"Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.",Claim

37020,It would have been increase in sectarian violence.,Claim
37071,"It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.",None

37520,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.",Claim
37698,"Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.",Premise
38064,We hadn't caught bin Laden.,Premise
38092,"We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.",Claim

48166,"And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.",Claim
48485,"So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.",Claim
48539,It's not just more troops.,Premise

50755,It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.,None
50806,And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.,Claim
50914,And it's going to be tough.,None
50942,They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.,Claim
50994,And it's going to be tough.,Claim
51022,But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.,Premise

51332,So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.,Premise
51381,"But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.",Claim
51645,So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.,Claim
51699,It's a strategy that will succeed.,Premise

52190,"Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.",Premise
52264,"And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.",Claim
52357,"But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.",None
52550,I think this is the right strategy.,Premise
52587,"Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.",Premise
52642,This is not an easy situation.,Premise
52673,You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.,Claim
52727,And we've got a choice.,Claim
52751,"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.",Premise
52938,"And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.",None
53117,"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.""",Claim
53232,"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.",None

53526,I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.,None
53648,"Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.",None

54559,"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",Claim

76675,Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.,None
76863,Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.,Claim

77016,"So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.",Claim
77119,That made no sense whatsoever.,Premise
77151,And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.,Claim
77291,That wasn't done.,None
77309,"But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.",Claim

77441,"Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.",Claim
77555,"That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.",Premise
77792,"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",Claim
77965,So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,None
78019,"What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.",Claim

78289,"And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.",None
78450,"Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.",Premise
78561,"And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.",None

79259,"John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.",Claim
79306,... it's hard to get there from here.,None
79344,And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.,Premise
79428,"And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.",None
79568,"And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",None
79657,"I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.",None

80107,I -- I just have to correct the record here.,Claim
80152,I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.,None
80202,What I've said is that we have to store it safely.,None

80827,"And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.",Claim
80889,What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?,None
81014,I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.,Claim
81069,"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",Premise

81264,"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.",Premise
81324,"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.",Premise
81493,"And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",Claim
81603,"And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.",None
81727,"And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.",Premise
81798,And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.,Claim
81908,"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.",Claim
82028,So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.,Claim

82605,"And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.",Claim

84675,We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.,Premise
84763,And this is the greatest country on Earth.,Premise
84806,"But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",Premise
85189,Do you agree there's much to be done in a new administration to restore... (CROSSTALK),Claim

16106,Governor?,Claim
16124,I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you.,Claim

1429,We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.,None

1671,I understand that you flipped a coin.,None
1710,"And, Senator Obama, you will begin tonight.",None

2290,I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,Claim
2383,"And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.",Claim
2542,"And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.",Claim
2860,It hasn't worked out that way.,Premise
2891,And so now we've got to take some decisive action.,Premise
2951,"Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.",Premise
3013,We've got to make sure that works properly.,Premise
3057,"And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.",Claim
3183,It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.,Claim
3330,"And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.",Premise
3462,"And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.",Claim
3567,But that's only step one.,None
3593,The middle-class need a rescue package.,Claim
3633,And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.,Claim
3680,It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.,Claim
3747,It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.,Claim

4635,We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.,Claim
4740,We have to keep Americans' taxes low.,Claim

4922,"Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?",Premise
5061,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.,Claim
5168,"And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.",Claim
5294,You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.,Premise
5418,"As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.",Claim
5751,Is it expensive?,Premise
5768,Yes.,Claim
5773,"But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.",Claim
5929,And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.,Claim
5995,"I know how the do that, my friends.",Claim
6031,"And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.",Premise
6124,"But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.",Claim
6225,Thank you.,None
6246,"Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here.",None

6558,(LAUGHTER),None
6579,"No, with good reason.",None
6610,"You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.",Premise
6686,"But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.",Claim
6837,A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.,Premise
6887,"He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.",Premise
7032,"I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.",Premise

7143,Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.,Premise
7273,Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.,None
7332,But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.,Claim
7418,"Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.",Premise
7655,All right.,None
7666,"Senator McCain -- Senator Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?",None
7755,"Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.",Premise
7854,But there are other folks out there.,Premise
7891,The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.,Claim
8011,Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.,Premise
8057,We've got to help the middle class.,Claim
8102,"And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.",Premise
8307,"Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.",Claim
8392,"For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.",Claim
8480,"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.",Claim
8749,Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.,Claim
8817,But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.,Claim
8873,That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.,Premise
8962,"Senator Obama, thank you very much.",None
8998,"May I remind both of you, if I can, that we're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so.",None
9179,"We're going to go now, Senator McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark (ph), who is over here in section F.  Oliver?",None
9357,"Well, Senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time.",Premise
9461,"And through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out.",Premise
9579,"Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.",Premise
9849,"I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.",Premise
10152,"But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",Claim
10261,"I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.",None
10334,"But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.",Claim
10562,"And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.",Claim
10679,We've got to stop this greed and excess.,Claim
10721,"Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing.",Premise
10846,They resisted any change.,Premise
10873,"Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions.",Premise
10948,Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.,Premise
11058,"So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.",Claim
11156,But it's not enough.,Claim
11177,"That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.",Claim
11434,"But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire.",Claim
11518,There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it.,Premise
11591,There were others who took a hike.,Premise
11636,Senator Obama?,None
11659,"Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.",None
11734,"Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.",Premise
11895,"If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.",Claim
11962,"If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.",Claim
12059,"And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.",Claim
12178,"So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.",Premise
12274,But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.,Claim
12328,"Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.",None
12413,"Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.",Claim
12538,"Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.",Premise
12625,"On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.",Premise
12736,"I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.",Premise
12901,"A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.",Claim
13000,And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.,Claim
13132,"Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.",Premise
13269,He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.,Premise
13347,And I never promoted Fannie Mae.,Claim
13380,"In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.",Claim
13480,"So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.",None
13560,"What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?",Premise
13645,This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.,Claim
13719,And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.,Claim
13844,"The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.",Premise
13948,"And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.",Claim
14169,"Senator Obama, time for a discussion.",None
14207,I'm going to begin with you.,None
14236,Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?,None
14453,"No, I am confident about the American economy.",Claim
14500,But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.,Claim
14638,"The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.",Claim
14745,We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.,Claim
14850,"But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.",Claim
15225,"Senator McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?",None
15335,I think it depends on what we do.,Claim
15369,"I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.",Claim
15691,"My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.",Premise
15802,Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.,Claim
15848,The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy.,Claim
15906,Americans' workers are the best in the world.,Claim
15952,They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.,Premise
16006,They're the most innovative.,Premise
16035,They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.,Premise
16110,We're the best importers.,Premise
16136,They're most effective.,Premise
16160,They are the best workers in the world.,Premise
16201,And we've got to give them a chance.,Claim
16238,They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.,Claim
16309,And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time.,Claim
16418,We can do it.,Claim
16442,"Thank you, Senator McCain.",None
16469,"We're going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.",None
16530,"Senator Obama, this is a question from you from Theresa Finch (ph).",None
16599,Theresa (ph)?,None
16625,How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis?,None
16745,"Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.",Premise
16923,"If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.",Claim
16975,Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.,Premise
17017,Maybe you put off buying a new car.,Premise
17053,That's not what happens in Washington.,Premise
17092,And you're right.,Claim
17110,There is a lot of blame to go around.,Claim
17149,But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.,Claim
17218,"When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.",Premise
17271,And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.,Claim
17329,"When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.",Premise
17414,It's now over $10 trillion.,Claim
17442,We've almost doubled it.,Premise
17467,"And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.",Claim
17644,And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.,Premise
17721,So here's what I would do.,Premise
17748,I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.,Claim
17832,"You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.",Premise
17893,We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.,Claim
17954,We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.,Premise
18082,We are mortgaging our children's future.,Claim
18123,We've got to have a different energy plan.,Claim
18167,We've got to invest in college affordability.,Claim
18213,"So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.",Claim
18304,"And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.",Premise
18500,"The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.",Claim
18700,We've got to put an end to that.,Claim
18743,Senator McCain?,None
18768,"Well, Theresa (ph), thank you.",None
18799,"And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.",Claim
18898,And I have been a consistent reformer.,Claim
18937,"I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change.",Premise
19231,I have a clear record of bipartisanship.,Claim
19272,The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.,Premise
19322,Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.,Premise
19399,And we need to reform.,Claim
19423,And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.,None
19481,That's really part of your mistrust here.,Premise

20113,New spending.,Claim
20127,Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?,Premise
20309,"He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.",Claim
20479,"My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?",Premise
20532,I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.,Claim
20599,"Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.",Claim
20832,"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.",Premise

23528,"Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.",Premise

23719,"And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.",Premise

24387,"Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.",Claim

24657,"But just one point I want to make, Tom.",None
24697,Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.,Premise

25026,But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.,Claim
25113,"So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.",Premise
25371,And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.,Claim
25489,That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.,Premise
25562,"All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time.",None
25636,We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.,None

27024,And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.,Claim
27124,So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.,Claim
27228,"And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.",Premise
27389,"And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.",Premise

31240,"Well, I think it starts with Washington.",Claim
31281,"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?",Premise

36055,"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one.",Claim

42060,"We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.",Premise

42281,This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.,Claim

43357,"He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.",Premise

43787,One last point I want to make on energy.,None
43828,"Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",Claim
43990,So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,Claim
44067,And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.,Premise
44208,"We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.",Claim

44934,It's a simple question.,None
44968,Sure.,None
44983,"Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?",None
45228,I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.,Claim
45347,"I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.",Claim
45457,"By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.",Claim

45985,"I vote against them, my friends.",Claim
46018,I vote against them.,Claim
46039,"But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.",Claim
46146,"We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.",Claim
46385,That's fundamental economics.,None
46415,"We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.",Claim
46503,"And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.",None
46572,Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.,Premise
46648,"And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.",Claim
46694,Thanks.,None
46712,"Thank you very much, Senator.",None

46859,Lindsey?,None
46880,"Senator, selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry.",None
46996,Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?,None
47066,"Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.",None

47506,"If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.",Claim
47559,So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.,Claim
47778,So here's what I would do.,None
47805,"If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.",Claim

47971,"We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.",Claim
48070,And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.,Claim
48123,We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.,Claim
48320,That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.,Premise
48371,"If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.",Claim
48519,"Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.",Premise
48571,"And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.",Claim
48654,"Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.",None
48708,"He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.",Premise
48765,What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.,Claim
48884,"So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.",Premise
48937,He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.,Claim
49164,And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.,Premise
49212,"In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.",Premise
49440,"That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.",Claim
49497,"We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.",Claim
49614,And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.,Premise
49687,Senator McCain?,None
49712,"Well, thank you for the question.",None
49746,You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.,None
49823,"Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.",Premise
49951,And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.,Claim
50033,"Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.",Claim
50118,Let's have community health centers.,Claim
50155,Let's have walk-in clinics.,Claim
50183,Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.,Claim
50233,But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.,Claim
50349,"As you notice, he starts talking about government.",None
50400,"He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.",Premise
50525,"If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.",Claim
50625,Will fine you.,None
50640,That's remarkable.,None

50835,"They can take it anywhere, across state lines.",Claim
50882,Why not?,Premise
50891,Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?,Premise
50964,Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.,Premise
51108,"And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.",Premise
51576,"You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.",None
51643,But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.,Claim
51768,Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.,Premise
51854,Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.,Claim
51933,Of course they all want to do that.,Premise
51969,We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.,Claim
52018,"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.",Claim
52166,Quick discussion.,None
52184,"Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?",None
52253,Senator McCain?,None
52279,"I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.",Claim
52438,"And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.",Premise
52496,But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.,Premise
52560,But it is certainly my responsibility.,Claim
52599,"It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.",Claim
52690,American citizens understand that.,Premise
52725,Employers understand that.,Premise
52753,"But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.",Claim
52920,"And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.",Premise
53000,Perhaps we might find that out tonight.,Premise
53049,"Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.",None
53167,"Privilege, right or responsibility.",None
53203,Let's start with that.,None
53234,"Well, I think it should be a right for every American.",Claim
53289,"In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.",Premise
53718,So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.,None
53783,"And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.",Premise
53889,"Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.",Claim
53986,All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.,Claim
54047,You'll still have choice of doctor.,Premise
54083,There's no mandate involved.,Premise
54113,Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.,Premise
54163,What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.,Claim
54273,"Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.",Premise
54509,"And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.",Claim
54802,"Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.",Claim
55195,"And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?",Claim
55304,"They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.",Claim
55552,That's how in banking it works.,Premise
55584,"Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.",Premise
55702,"And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.",Claim
55860,That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.,Premise
55926,He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.,Premise
55977,That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.,Premise
56040,"It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.",Claim
56100,"Senator, we want to move on now.",None

56475,Phil?,None
56493,Yes.,None
56498,"Senator McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?",None
56628,"Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well.",Claim
56802,And that is one of the challenges that America faces.,Premise
56856,"But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.",None
56924,"I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.",None
57059,"But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.",Claim
57144,"My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.",Premise
57297,So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.,Claim
57343,"But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.",Claim
57569,"And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.",Claim
57982,"And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.",Claim
58244,Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.,Premise
58294,He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.,Premise

58715,It's true.,Claim
58726,There are some things I don't understand.,Premise
58768,"I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.",Premise
58968,That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.,Claim
59035,"When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.",Premise
59183,"That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.",Claim
59240,"So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.",Premise
59458,But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.,Claim
59510,"We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.",Claim
59673,"We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.",Premise
59784,"And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.",Claim
60007,"Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.",Premise
60081,We are a force of good in the world.,Claim
60118,But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.,Claim
60251,"And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.",Claim
60560,"That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.",Claim
60708,It has not worked for America.,Claim
60749,"Senator Obama, let me ask you if -- let's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where there's a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security.",None
61006,"Take the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia.",None
61127,What is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we don't have national security issues at stake?,None
61268,"Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.",Premise
61367,"If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?",Premise
61494,"If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.",Claim
61630,"So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.",Premise
61774,"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.",Claim
61903,But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.,None
61966,We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.,Premise
62024,That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.,Claim
62108,Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.,None
62160,Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.,Premise
62332,"We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.",Claim
62516,And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.,Premise
62577,"Senator McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.",None
62636,"Well, let me just follow up, my friends.",None
62677,"If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.",Premise
63051,"There was a lot at stake there, my friends.",None
63095,And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.,Claim

63277,"The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.",Claim
63355,"And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.",Claim
63492,But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.,Claim
63578,That requires a cool hand at the tiller.,Claim
63619,This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.,Claim
63705,"We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.",Premise
63918,"In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?",Premise
64066,And said we shouldn't.,Premise
64089,"Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.",Premise
64149,"So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.",Claim
64331,"And, again, I know those situations.",Claim
64369,I've been in them all my life.,Premise
64400,And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.,Claim
64560,And I may have to make those tough decisions.,Premise
64606,But I won't take them lightly.,Premise
64637,And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.,Claim
64728,"But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.",Claim
64918,"Senator McCain, thank you very much.",None
64955,"Next question for Senator Obama, it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm (ph).",None
65045,Katie?,None
65064,"Should the United States respect Pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al Qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there, or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in Cambodia during the Vietnam War?",None
65293,"Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.",Premise
65372,I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.,Premise
65586,"So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.",Claim
65765,"They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.",Claim
65842,They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.,Claim
65892,"And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.",Claim
66007,They are plotting to kill Americans right now.,Claim
66054,"As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.",Premise
66180,"So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.",Claim
66445,But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.,Claim
66513,"We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.",Premise
66659,"What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.",Premise

72718,Cowper-Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator.,None
72777,"If either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize Afghanistan's strategy or do you?",None
72889,"Briefly, if you can.",Claim
72919,I'll be very brief.,Claim
72939,"We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.",Premise
73149,"General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.",Claim
73331,"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.""",Premise
73568,I don't think he has to be a dictator.,Claim
73607,And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.,None
73647,"But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.",Claim
73781,"Senator McCain, briefly.",None
73815,"General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.",Claim
73980,And I've had conversations with him.,Claim
74017,It is the same overall strategy.,Claim
74050,"Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on.",Claim
74143,We have to double the size of the Afghan army.,Claim
74190,We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.,Claim
74244,We have to do a lot of things.,Claim
74275,We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.,Premise
74331,"But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.",Premise
74495,"He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.",Claim
74685,"And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.",Claim
74818,"So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.",None
74969,We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.,None
75071,"Senator McCain, this question is for you from the Internet.",None
75131,"It's from Alden (ph) in Hewitt, Texas.",Claim
75170,How can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War?,Claim
75298,"First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.",Premise
75398,"But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.",Premise
75594,"Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.",Premise
75640,"I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.",Premise
75711,He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks.,None
75767,"He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.",Claim
75932,"I said before, watch Ukraine.",Claim
75962,"Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.",Claim
76071,We've got to show moral support for Georgia.,Claim
76126,We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.,Claim
76171,We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.,Premise
76223,"We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.",Claim
76403,"And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior.",Premise
76549,"Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.",None
76607,"But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.",Claim
76912,Senator Obama.,None
76936,"It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.",None
77018,Senator Obama?,Claim
77033,"We're winding down, so if we can keep track of the time.",None
77098,"Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.",Premise
77220,And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.,Claim
77314,But we can't just provide moral support.,Claim
77355,We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.,Claim
77485,But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.,Premise
77592,Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.,Claim
77667,And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.,Claim
77733,"The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.",Claim
77812,We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.,Premise
77874,"You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.",Claim
78060,"And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.",Premise
78221,"So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.",Premise
78408,We haven't been doing enough of that.,Claim
78446,We tend to be reactive.,Premise
78470,That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.,Claim
78566,"That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.",None
78808,We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.,Claim
78930,And one last point I want to make about Russia.,Premise
78978,Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.,Premise
79028,"If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.",None
79160,That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.,Premise
79248,This requires only a yes or a no.,Premise
79282,Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire.,Claim
79353,Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire?,None
79426,I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.,Claim
79638,Senator McCain?,None
79663,Maybe.,Premise
79670,(LAUGHTER),Premise
79691,Maybe.,Claim
79707,Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.,Claim
79778,"If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War.",Claim
79848,"If I say no, it ignores their behavior.",Premise
79888,"Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.",Claim
79939,And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.,Claim
80010,And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.,None
80067,"But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.",None
80300,All right.,None
80311,"We're going to try to get in two more questions, if we can.",None
80371,So we have to move along.,None
80397,"Over in section A, Terry Chary (ph) -- do I have that right, Terry?",None
80475,"Senator, as a retired Navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country.",Premise

80643,"If, despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel, would you be willing to commit U.S. troops in support and defense of Israel?",None
80783,Or would you wait on approval from the U.N. Security Council?,None
80854,"Well, thank you, Terry (ph).",None
80883,And thank you for your service to the country.,None

81071,Thanks for serving.,Claim
81092,Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.,Claim
81191,I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.,Premise
81288,"And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.",Claim
81408,It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel.,Claim
81465,It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.,Premise
81524,"If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.",Premise
81606,The tensions will be ratcheted up.,Claim
81642,"What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?",Premise
81822,"Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.",Premise
81928,"That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.",Claim
81979,"I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.",Claim
82171,And I think we can do that.,Claim
82200,"I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.",None
82404,"But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.",None
82616,Senator Obama?,Claim
82639,"Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.",Claim
82716,We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.,Premise
82762,It would be a game-changer in the region.,Claim
82804,"Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.",Claim
83015,And so it's unacceptable.,Claim
83041,And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.,Premise
83098,And we will never take military options off the table.,Premise
83153,And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.,Claim
83272,"It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.",None
83414,"And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.",Claim
83986,That starts putting the squeeze on them.,Premise
84028,"Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.",None
84283,"If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.",Claim
84381,"Now, it may not work.",Premise
84403,"But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.",Claim
84569,"When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?",Claim
84694,"Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.",Claim
84763,North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.,None
84811,"We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.",None

85354,"My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.",Claim
85435,"And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.",None
85483,"But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.",None
85667,It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.,Claim
85744,But here's what I do know.,Premise
85771,I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.,Premise
85877,I came from very modest means.,Premise
85908,"I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.",Claim
86171,"Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.",Premise
86334,The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.,Claim
86413,And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?,Claim
86524,"Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.",Claim
86584,Wages and incomes have gone down.,Claim
86618,People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.,Claim
86698,"We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.",Claim
86827,"And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.",None
86982,We need fundamental change.,Premise
87010,That's what's at stake in this election.,Claim
87051,"That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.",None
87208,"But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.",None
87310,Thank you.,None
87329,"Senator McCain, you get the last word.",None
87368,Senator Obama had the opening.,None

3425,"But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.",Claim
3503,Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.,Premise
3563,The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.,Premise
3730,"I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.",Premise
3979,"Now, we have allocated $750 billion.",Premise
4016,"Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.",Claim

4276,"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?",None
4333,That paid their mortgage payments?,None

4673,"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.",None
4847,I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,Premise
4971,And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.,Claim
5065,And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.,Claim
5184,Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.,Claim
5258,And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.,Claim
5324,But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.,Claim
5395,Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.,Premise
5477,So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.,None
5539,"Number one, let's focus on jobs.",Claim
5572,I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.,Claim

5972,Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.,Premise
6053,That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.,Claim
6189,"I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.",Premise
6395,And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.,Premise
6438,And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.,Claim
6529,"Last point I want to make, though.",None
6564,We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.,Claim
6644,We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.,Premise

7177,And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.,Premise

31702,"The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.",Claim

35730,"In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.",Claim
35839,This has been their primary focus.,Premise
35874,So let's get the record straight.,Premise
35908,Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.,Premise
35960,"Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.",Premise
36062,I have roundly condemned those acts.,Premise

36257,"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.",Claim
36482,Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.,Claim
36524,He has never been involved in this campaign.,Claim
36569,And he will not advise me in the White House.,None
36615,So that's Mr. Ayers.,Premise
36637,"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.",Premise
36700,"Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.",Claim
36910,It had nothing to do with us.,Claim
36940,We were not involved.,Premise
36962,The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.,Premise
37155,"Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.",None
37342,Let me tell you who I associate with.,Claim
37380,"On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.",Claim
37470,"If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.",Claim
37735,"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.",Claim
37860,"And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",Claim
38022,"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.",Claim
38145,So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.,Claim
38227,That's absolutely not true.,None
38264,And the facts are facts and records are records.,Claim
38321,And that's not the facts.,Premise

38547,It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.,Claim
38719,"And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.",Claim
38838,And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,Claim
38971,And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.,None
39043,All right.,None
39054,Let's go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion.,None
39163,I want to ask both of you about the people that you're going to bring into the government.,None
39254,And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.,None
39337,"So I'll begin by asking both of you this question, and I'll ask you to answer first, Senator Obama.",None
39437,Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?,Claim
39549,"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.",Premise
39645,It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.,Premise
39727,"And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.",Premise
39806,"But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.",Premise
40052,"And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.",Premise
40152,That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.,Premise
40256,"That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.",Claim
40381,"Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.",Claim
40542,"Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.",Claim
41075,"So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.",None
41293,Senator?,None
41311,"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.",Claim

41765,"She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.",Claim
41953,She's a reformer through and through.,Claim
41991,And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.,Claim
42229,She'll be my partner.,Claim
42251,She understands reform.,Claim
42275,"And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.",Premise
42337,"She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.",Claim
42571,She understands that better than almost any American that I know.,None
42637,I'm proud of her.,Premise
42656,And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.,None
42770,And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.,None
42826,"Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.",None
42890,Do you think she's qualified to be president?,None
42944,"You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.",Claim
43016,"I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.",Claim
43133,And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.,Premise
43215,"I agree with that, John.",Claim
43241,"I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research.",Premise
43408,That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.,Claim
43503,"And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.",Premise
43592,"That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.",None
43736,Do you think Senator Biden is qualified?,Claim
43786,I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.,Claim
43840,"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.",Premise
43971,He voted against the first Gulf War.,Premise
44008,"He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.",Premise
44148,"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.",Premise
44227,"We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.",Premise
44299,We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.,Premise
44377,"There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.",None
44548,"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?",None
44728,"Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?",None
44816,Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.,None
45047,Let's go to -- let's go to a new topic.,None
45087,We're running a little behind.,None
45118,Let's talk about energy and climate control.,None
45163,Every president since Nixon has said what both of you...,None
45230,Climate change.,None
45258,"Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.",None
45378,"When Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil.",None
45452,"Now, we're importing more than 60 percent.",None
45496,"Would each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?",None
45637,"And I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain.",Claim
45709,"I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.",None
45824,Canadian oil is fine.,Premise
45846,"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.""",Claim
46018,You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.,Premise
46107,"We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.",Premise
46215,We can store and we can reprocess.,Premise
46251,"Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.",Premise
46347,"Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.",Claim
46442,"We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.",Claim
46517,"So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.",Claim
46739,"So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.",None
46966,All right.,None
46977,"Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?",Claim
47079,"I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.",Claim
47210,I think that's about a realistic timeframe.,Claim
47254,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.,Premise
47333,"Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.",Claim
47385,But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.,Premise
47507,It's mortgaging our children's future.,Premise
47547,"Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.",Premise
47675,"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",Claim
47887,And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.,Premise
48009,"But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.",Claim
48191,"That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.",Claim
48277,"These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.",Claim
48510,We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.,None
48634,Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.,Claim
48774,I believe in free trade.,Claim
48799,"But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.",Premise
49006,And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.,Claim
49104,And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.,Claim
49175,In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,Premise
49329,"And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.",None
49489,That's all good.,Premise
49506,"We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.",Claim
49555,That is not free trade.,Claim
49579,We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.,None
49738,Senator?,Premise
49756,"Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence.",Claim
49816,And you really have to pay attention to words.,Premise
49863,"He said, we will look at offshore drilling.",Premise
49907,Did you get that?,None
49925,Look at.,Premise
49934,We can offshore drill now.,Claim
49961,We've got to do it now.,Premise
49985,We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.,Claim
50088,It's doable.,Premise
50101,The technology is there and we have to drill now.,None
50151,"Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.",None
50197,I am a free trader.,Claim
50217,"And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.",Premise
50346,But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.,Premise
50436,"Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.",Premise
50732,"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.",Premise
50821,"So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.",Premise
50926,The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.,Premise
51041,And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.,Claim
51324,Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.,Claim
51383,But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.,None
51496,Let me respond.,Claim
51512,"Actually, I understand it pretty well.",Premise
51551,The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.,Premise
51711,"And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.",Claim
52113,But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.,None
52325,"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",Premise
52385,"When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.",Claim
52468,They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.,Premise
52534,"And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.",Claim
52630,"That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.",None
52827,And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.,Premise
52900,It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.,Premise
53033,"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",Premise
53449,"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",Premise
53729,"Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.",Claim
53977,So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,Premise
54095,"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.",Claim
54229,We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.,None
54332,"All right, let's go to a new topic, health care.",None
54381,"Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage?",None
54516,The question is first to Senator Obama.,Claim
54564,"We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.",Premise
54624,"Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.",Premise
54728,"Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.",Premise
54790,"Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.",Premise
54889,Neither of them have health insurance.,Premise
54929,"And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.",None
55077,So here's what my plan does.,Claim
55106,"If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.",Claim
55172,"If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.",Claim
55307,The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.,Claim
55410,"And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.",Claim
55492,"If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.",Claim

58807,"You won't pay a fine, because...",None
58849,Zero?,Premise

59618,We exempt small businesses.,Premise

59851,"If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.",None

60046,"He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.",Premise
60102,That sounds pretty good.,Premise
60127,And you can go out and buy your own insurance.,Claim
60175,"Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.",Premise
60305,"This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.",Claim
60412,"Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.",Claim
60599,"And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.",None
60774,"And this is your plan, John.",Claim
60803,"For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.",Premise
60885,"By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.",Premise
60937,"So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.",Premise
61021,"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.",Claim
61328,"That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.",None
61474,What about that?,None
61500,"Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.",Claim

62091,That's big government at its best.,Claim

64043,And don't take my word for it.,Premise

64555,Could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue?,None
64656,Senator McCain?,Claim
64682,I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.,Claim
64795,That's not appropriate to do.,None
64837,But you don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?,Claim
64895,I thought it was a bad decision.,Claim
64928,I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.,Claim
64981,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.,Premise
65044,I'm a federalist.,Claim
65062,And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.,Premise
65208,"Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.",Premise
65314,Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.,Premise
65442,"We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.",Premise
65494,You were offered a chance to join.,Premise
65529,"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges.""",Premise
65624,I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.,Premise
65673,"Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.",Premise
65825,This is a very important issue we're talking about.,Premise
65878,Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.,Claim
66005,That's not the way we should judge these nominees.,Premise
66056,Elections have consequences.,Premise
66085,They should be judged on their qualifications.,Claim
66132,And so that's what I will do.,Claim
66163,I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.,Claim
66299,And not legislating from the bench.,None
66348,"But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?",Claim
66473,I would consider anyone in their qualifications.,Claim
66522,I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.,Claim
66626,But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,None
66688,All right.,Claim
66707,"Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.",Claim
66892,"And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.",Premise
67005,It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.,Claim
67158,Now I would not provide a litmus test.,Claim
67197,But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.,Claim
67270,I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.,Claim
67407,"But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.",Premise
67577,"And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.",Claim
67857,So this is going to be an important issue.,Claim
67900,"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.",Premise
68069,I'll just give you one quick example.,Premise
68107,Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.,Premise
68271,"For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.",Premise
68368,"And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.",Premise
68571,We tried to overturn it in the Senate.,Premise
68610,I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.,Claim
68701,"I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.",Claim
68923,And that's the kind of judge that I want.,None
68978,Time's up.,None
68998,"Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.",None
69100,It was a trial lawyer's dream.,None
69131,Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.,Claim
69191,We have to change the culture of America.,Premise
69233,Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.,Claim
69287,And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.,Premise
69407,"Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.",Premise
69596,He voted against that.,Premise
69620,"And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.",Premise
69723,"Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.",Premise

70043,"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that.",Premise
70096,I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.,Claim
70198,"And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.",None
70257,"And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.",Claim
70345,"It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.",None
70489,Response?,None
70507,"Yes, let me respond to this.",Premise
70536,"If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.",None
70657,The -- here are the facts.,Premise
70684,There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.,Premise
70853,"The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.",Premise
71054,"And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.",Premise
71147,"Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.",Claim
71255,"With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.",Premise
71491,"And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.",Claim
71582,"And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.",None
71733,The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.,Premise
71789,"This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.",Premise
71835,"And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.",Premise
71908,"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.""",Premise
72351,"Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.",Premise
72529,I think it's always a tragic situation.,Claim
72578,We should try to reduce these circumstances.,None
72635,Let's give Senator McCain a short response...,None
72690,Just again...,None
72716,... and then...,Premise
72741,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.",Premise
72800,He's health for the mother.,Claim

73287,"Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.",None
73600,"Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I'm afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.",None
73740,The question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education.,None
73831,"Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.",None
73992,The implications of this are clearly obvious.,None
74038,Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.,None
74097,Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?,None
74158,The question to Senator Obama first.,Premise
74204,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.",Claim
74465,So we've got to get our education system right.,Claim
74513,"Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.",Claim
74631,"In some cases, we are going to have to invest.",Premise
74678,"Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.",Claim
74928,"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.",Claim
75207,And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.,Premise
75269,"Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.",Claim
75663,"And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.",Claim
75887,"If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.",Premise
75969,"But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.",Premise
76050,We can't do it just in the schools.,Claim
76086,Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.,Premise
76141,"They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.",None
76297,Senator McCain?,None
76322,"Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.",None
76377,There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.,None
76501,But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?,Premise
76620,"So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.",Premise
76879,And we find bad teachers another line of work.,Claim
76926,"And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.",Premise
77125,"Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.",Premise
77200,They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.,Claim
77298,"Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.",Premise
77352,You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.,Claim
77448,So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.,Premise
77515,"We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.",None
77784,"Look, we must improve education in this country.",Claim
77833,"As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.",Claim
77922,We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.,Claim
77984,We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.,Claim
78048,And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.,None
78136,Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools?,None
78214,"And I mean, more federal money?",Premise
78254,"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.",Claim
78360,But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.,Premise
78505,Now we tried to do this under President Bush.,Premise
78551,He put forward No Child Left Behind.,Premise
78588,"Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.",Premise
78656,"And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.",Claim
79025,"So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.",Premise
79150,Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.,Premise
79225,"Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.",Claim
79342,I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.,Claim
79415,"And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.",Premise
79660,Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.,Premise
79807,And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.,Premise
79921,"Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.",Claim
80157,"I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.",Premise
80236,And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.,Claim
80304,We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.,Claim
80413,"And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.",Premise

82436,And we'll care for these young children.,Claim
82477,And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.,Premise
82556,"But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.",Claim

82833,But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.,Claim

83433,"She supports vouchers, also.",Premise
83470,"But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.",Premise
83793,That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.,Claim
83905,"So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.",Claim
84021,And that's what I intend to do as president.,None
84079,All right.,Premise

5886,"The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.",Premise

7000,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.,Claim
7072,"When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.",Claim
7262,But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,Claim
7377,I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.,Claim
7467,"On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.",Premise
7641,"But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",Claim
7791,So all of this is possible.,Claim
7819,"Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?",Claim
7980,"And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?",None
8123,"And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.",Premise
8413,That's $8 trillion.,Premise
8433,"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",Claim
8646,"Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.",None
8787,"But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?",None

9700,It's been crushing.,Claim
9721,"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.",Premise
9789,Electric rates are up.,Premise
9812,Food prices are up.,Premise
9832,"Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.",Premise

9935,And so the question is how to get them going again.,Claim
9987,And I've described it.,None
10010,"It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.",Claim
10119,Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.,Premise
10165,But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.,None
10233,"First, education.",Premise
10251,"I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.",Claim
10318,"But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.",Premise
10450,Overhead is overwhelming.,Premise
10476,We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.,Premise
10657,"The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.",Claim
10732,"And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.",None
10785,"But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.",Premise
10992,"The third area, energy.",None
11016,"Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.",Premise
11126,But not due to his policies.,Claim
11155,In spite of his policies.,Claim
11182,"Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.",Premise
11294,"On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.",Premise
11386,"If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.",Claim
11476,And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.,Claim
11522,"And, by the way, I like coal.",None
11552,I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.,Claim
11611,People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.,Premise
11688,I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.,Claim
11777,"And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.",Claim
11922,"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.",Claim
12007,I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.,Claim
12071,But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.,Premise
12145,"And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.",Claim
12244,So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.,None
12315,Mr. President?,None
12339,"Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.",Claim
12414,"Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",Premise
12520,And that's exactly what I did.,Claim
12551,"We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.",Premise
12607,"And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.",Premise
12697,"And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.",Premise
12815,They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.,Claim
12916,"They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.",Premise
13114,"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.",Claim
13283,And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.,Premise
13368,"The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.",Claim
13514,"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.",None
13576,All right.,None
13595,"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.",Claim
13857,And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.,Premise
14067,"The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.",Premise
14142,"Now, that's not my analysis.",Premise
14171,That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.,Premise
14230,"And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.",Claim
14512,All right.,None
14523,What is the difference?,None
14547,Let's just stay on taxes.,None
14573,(CROSSTALK),None
14595,Just -- let's just stay on taxes for (inaudible).,None
14645,(CROSSTALK),None
14667,What is the difference...,None
14702,"Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.",Claim
14808,All right.,None
14828,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.",Claim
14924,I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.,Claim
14967,What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.,Claim
15042,That's part one.,None
15059,So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.,Premise
15193,"Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.",Claim
15266,"I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.",Premise

15808,"Now, you cite a study.",Premise
15831,There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.,Premise

16048,There are all these studies out there.,Premise
16087,But let's get at the bottom line.,None
16121,"That is, I want to bring down rates.",Claim
16158,"I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.",Claim
16305,"And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?",None
16364,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.",Premise
16561,"And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.",Claim
16627,"For me, this is about jobs.",Claim
16655,This is about getting jobs for the American people.,Claim
16707,(CROSSTALK),None
16729,That's where we started.,None
16754,Yeah.,None
16760,Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?,None
16834,"Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.",Premise
16890,"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind.""",Premise
16985,"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.",Claim
17249,It's -- it's math.,Premise
17268,It's arithmetic.,Premise
17286,"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",None
17376,"So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.",None
17519,And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.,Claim
17642,"But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.",Premise
17895,"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",Premise
18150,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.",None
18235,"Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.",Claim
18330,"Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.",Premise
18425,"But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.",Premise
18548,Donald Trump is a small business.,Premise
18582,"Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.",Claim
18745,"And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.",Premise
19085,And I think that would be a mistake.,Claim
19132,All right.,None

19967,But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.,Premise
20109,Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.,Claim
20189,And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.,Premise

20328,He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.,Premise
20381,He has four employees.,Premise
20404,"He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.",Premise
20576,It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.,Claim
20633,And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.,Premise
20733,"The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.",Claim
20822,I don't want to cost jobs.,Claim
20849,My priority is jobs.,Claim
20870,"And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.",Claim
21213,That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.,None

21811,"But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.",Premise
21904,"Look, we've tried this.",Premise
21928,We've tried both approaches.,Premise
21957,"The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Premise

25738,I understand.,Premise

25943,What things would I cut from spending?,Claim
25982,"Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?",Claim

29037,"Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",None

37279,"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.",Premise
37393,Of course it's on the table.,Premise
37422,That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.,Premise
37497,"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.",None
37642,"I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?",Claim
37750,So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.,Premise
37867,"The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.",Premise
37952,"Look, I've been in business for 25 years.",Premise
37994,I have no idea what you're talking about.,None
38036,I maybe need to get a new accountant.,None
38084,Let's...,Claim
38102,But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.,None
38194,(CROSSTALK),Claim
38216,What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.,None
38321,"And, finally, Medicaid to states?",Claim
38355,"I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.",Premise
38657,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.",Premise
38808,We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.,Premise
38950,So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.,Claim
39088,Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.,Claim
39231,Let states do this.,Premise
39252,"And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.",None
39371,Let's go.,Claim
39390,"But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.",None
39534,"(inaudible) and we're going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another part of it...",None
39638,OK.,None
39651,All right?,None
39662,All right.,None
39673,"This is segment three, the economy.",None
39709,Entitlements.,None
39723,"First -- first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President.",None
39786,Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?,Claim
39867,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.",Premise
39952,Social Security is structurally sound.,Claim
39991,It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.,Premise
40103,But it is -- the basic structure is sound.,Claim
40146,"But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.",Premise
40314,"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.",Premise
40382,My grandparents did.,Premise
40403,My grandfather died a while back.,Premise
40437,My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.,Premise
40500,And she was fiercely independent.,Premise
40534,"She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.",Premise
40666,And she ended up living alone by choice.,Claim
40708,And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.,Premise
40793,"She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.",Claim
40929,And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.,Premise
41011,"You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.",Premise
41098,"These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",Claim
41233,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?",Premise
41311,"And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.",Premise
41510,$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.,Premise
41667,"And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.",Claim
41955,So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.,Claim
42040,"When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",None
42204,We'll follow up on this.,None
42229,"First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.",Claim
42321,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.",Claim
42523,"And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.",Claim
42677,"So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.",Claim
42755,"But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.",None
42841,"Oh, I just thought about one.",Claim
42871,"And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.",Premise
42981,In fact he is on Medicare.,Premise
43008,On Social Security he's not.,Premise
43038,"But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.",Premise
43121,"Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.",Premise
43177,"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.""",Claim
43321,That's not just going after places where there's abuse.,Claim
43377,That's saying we're cutting the rates.,Premise
43416,Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.,Premise
43531,We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.,Claim
43615,This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.,None
43743,I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.,Premise
43837,"Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.",None
43888,We're going to give a better prescription program.,Premise
43939,That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.,Premise
43988,They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.,Claim
44043,I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.,Claim
44118,"By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.",Claim
44195,"But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.",Claim
44332,"And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",None
44491,Mr. President?,Claim
44514,"First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",Claim
44643,And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.,Premise
44727,"It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.",None
44801,His running mate...,None
44831,And you don't support that?,Claim
44867,I don't.,None
44876,And let me explain why.,None
44909,"Again, that's for future...",None
44945,I understand.,None
44968,"... people, right, not for current retirees.",None
45021,"For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.",Premise
45126,"The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.",Premise
45336,"The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.",Premise
45512,"Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.",Premise
45617,"But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.",Premise
45774,"They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.",Premise
45840,"And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",Premise
45980,And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.,Claim
46151,"So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.",Claim
46203,And this is not my own -- only my opinion.,Premise
46246,"AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.",Premise
46382,Benefits were not affected at all.,Premise
46417,"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care.",Claim
46622,They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.,Premise
46718,And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.,Claim
46884,And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.,None
47013,We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment.,None
47077,"But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor?",Claim
47143,What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.,Claim
47223,And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,None
47300,And what about the vouchers?,None
47329,(CROSSTALK),None
47351,So that's -- that's number one.,Claim
47383,"Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.",None
47586,Their choice.,Claim
47601,They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.,Premise
47701,"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.",Claim
47767,That's not going to happen.,Claim
47795,They'll have at least two plans.,Premise
47838,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.",Claim
48063,I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.,Premise
48117,I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.,Claim
48200,I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.,Premise
48249,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.",None
48333,But people make their own choice.,None
48368,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?,Claim
48416,"We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.",Claim
48562,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.,Claim
48624,That's the plan that I've put forward.,Premise
48664,"And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.",Premise
48873,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.",Premise
49089,I believe in competition.,Premise
49124,"Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.",Premise
49340,And private insurers have to make a profit.,Premise
49384,Nothing wrong with that.,Premise
49409,That's what they do.,Claim
49430,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.",Premise
49505,"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.",Claim
49656,"And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.",Claim
49762,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.",Premise
49851,And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.,Premise
49944,And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.,None
50011,One last point I want to make.,Claim
50042,"We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid...",None
50133,Talk about that in a minute.,None
50171,... but -- but -- but overall.,None
50211,OK.,None
50223,And so...,None
50242,That's -- that's a big topic.,None
50272,Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?,None

50766,"If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.",None
50861,"Wait a minute, Governor.",Premise
50895,But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.,None

51963,Every free economy has good regulation.,Claim
52003,"At the same time, regulation can become excessive.",Claim
52063,"Is it excessive now, do you think?",None
52107,"In some places, yes.",None

52155,Like where?,Premise
52167,(CROSSTALK),Claim
52189,"No, it can become out of date.",Premise
52220,"And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.",None
52398,Let me give you an example.,Premise
52426,Dodd-Frank was passed.,Premise
52449,And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.,Claim
52577,"One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.",Premise
52698,This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.,None
52781,This is an enormous boon for them.,None
52816,There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.,None

53039,We're not going to get rid of all regulation.,Claim
53085,You have to have regulation.,None

53423,Let's let him respond -- let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.,None
53542,I think this is a great example.,Premise
53575,The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.,Premise
53686,"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.",Premise
53722,"You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.",None
53862,You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.,Premise
53944,You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.,Premise
54037,"But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.",Premise
54249,So what did we do?,Premise
54268,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.,Premise

54840,"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.",Claim
54902,"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.",None
55026,"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.",None
55119,And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?,Claim

55425,"Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.",Claim
55474,That's why I'd have regulation.,Claim

55904,That's exactly right.,Premise
55926,It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.,Premise
55991,"And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.",Premise
56208,It's been two years.,Premise
56229,We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,Claim
56277,"So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.",Premise

56555,Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.,None
56612,"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",None
56772,All right.,None
56783,I think we have another clear difference between the two of you.,None
56848,"Now, let's move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.",None
56981,"And it's a two-minute new -- new segment, and that means two minutes each.",None
57056,"And you go first, Governor Romney.",None
57100,You want it repealed.,Claim
57122,You want the Affordable Care Act repealed.,None
57165,Why?,Premise

57478,"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.",Premise
57644,And -- and we've got to deal with cost.,Premise
57685,"And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.",Premise
57850,So it's adding to cost.,Premise
57874,"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.",Premise
58047,"Instead, it's gone up by that amount.",None
58085,So it's expensive.,Claim
58104,Expensive things hurt families.,Claim
58136,So that's one reason I don't want it.,None
58175,"Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.",Claim
58240,I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.,None

58960,It has killed jobs.,Premise
58981,And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.,None

59245,"Mr. President, the argument against repeal?",Premise
59297,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.",Premise
59443,And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.,Premise
59608,"It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.",None
59833,"If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.",Premise
59918,"If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.",Premise
59998,"And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.",None
60208,"So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.",Claim
60351,And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.,Premise
60399,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.",None
60482,You keep your own insurance.,Premise
60511,You keep your own doctor.,Premise
60537,But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.,None
60596,They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.,Premise
60641,They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.,Claim
60745,And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.,None
60911,"Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.",None
61157,"Now, the last point I'd make before...",Premise
61206,"Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir.",None
61253,"No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ... (LAUGHTER)  ... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.",Claim
61588,It hasn't destroyed jobs.,None
61614,"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",None
61793,Your five seconds went away a long time ago.,None
61838,"All right, Governor.",None
61859,"Governor, tell -- tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?",None
61973,"Well, I did with my first statement.",Claim
62010,(CROSSTALK),Premise
62032,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.",None
62089,"I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.",Premise
62189,What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.,Claim
62271,"As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.",Premise
62426,"So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.",None
62666,"What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.",Premise
62833,What were some differences?,Premise
62861,We didn't raise taxes.,Premise
62884,You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.,Premise
62935,We didn't cut Medicare.,Premise
62959,"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.",Premise
63048,We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.,None
63153,"We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.",Premise
63353,"Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.",Premise
63468,"And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.",Premise
63610,"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.",Premise
63791,"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.",Premise
63875,They put a plan out.,Claim
63896,"They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.",None
63936,It was swept aside.,Claim
63957,"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.",Claim
64038,And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.,None
64178,Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.,Claim
64242,This was a bipartisan idea.,Premise
64270,"In fact, it was a Republican idea.",Premise
64305,And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.,Premise
64434,"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",Claim
64667,"It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?",Claim
64910,Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.,Claim
64986,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",Claim
65264,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?",Premise
65350,And there are ways of doing it.,Premise
65383,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.",Premise
65512,And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.,None
65573,"They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.",Premise
65729,Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.,Claim
65838,Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.,Claim
65977,"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.",Premise
66174,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.",Premise
66314,"And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.",None
66456,So we're already beginning to see progress.,Premise
66500,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.",None
66583,Let me make one last point.,Claim
66611,"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.",Claim
66729,"But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.",Claim
66870,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.",None
67136,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...",Premise
67261,Let's...,None
67278,... at a time when it's vitally important.,None
67330,Let's let the governor explain what you would do...,None
67391,Well...,None
67408,... if Obamacare is repealed.,None
67438,How would you replace it?,None
67464,(CROSSTALK),Claim
67486,"Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.",Claim
67545,"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.",Premise
67612,"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.",None
67676,That's already offered in the private marketplace.,Premise
67727,You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.,Premise
67797,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.",Claim
67967,"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.",Premise
68150,(CROSSTALK),Premise
68172,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.",Premise
68271,"As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.",None
68455,"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.",Premise
68558,This is the private market.,Premise
68586,"These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.",Claim
68697,"I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.",Claim
68786,I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.,Premise
68873,"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.",Premise
69016,"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.",Claim
69233,"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",Claim
69356,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",None
69559,That's the wrong way to go.,Claim
69587,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.,None
69663,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.,Premise
69788,That's explicitly prohibited in the law.,Claim
69829,"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.",None
69965,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",Premise
70022,"What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.",Claim
70276,But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.,Claim
70387,There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.,None
70470,It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,Premise
70518,It was the largest expansion of private insurance.,Premise
70569,"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody.""",Premise
70641,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers.",Premise
70694,"But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",Premise
70977,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",Premise
71086,"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.",Premise
71155,"He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.",None
71260,He won't tell us.,None
71278,He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.,Claim
71427,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",Claim
71604,Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?,None
71704,No.,Claim
71708,"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.",None
71890,And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.,None
72019,We're going to move to...,None
72054,No.,None
72058,I -- I have to respond to that.,Premise
72099,"No, but...",Premise
72119,"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done.",Premise
72290,What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.,Premise
72383,"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.",Premise
72474,He said he was going to lower tax rates.,Claim
72515,He said he was going to broaden the base.,Claim
72557,"You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.",None
72642,Those are my principles.,Claim
72667,I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.,Premise
72730,"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?",Premise
72867,"One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.",None
72924,"Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.",Premise
72960,Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.,Premise
73007,And then that number disappears for high-income people.,Claim
73063,That's one way one could do it.,None
73095,One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.,None
73201,"There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.",None
73361,"And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.",Claim
73469,You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.,None
73512,"In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.",Claim
73591,That's part of my health care plan.,Claim
73627,And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.,None
73702,And I said that at that time.,None
73733,"The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",None
73980,"That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government.",None
74057,And -- and let's see.,None
74079,Role of government.,None
74099,"And it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President.",None
74150,And the question is this.,Claim
74176,"Do you believe, both of you -- but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?",Claim
74404,"Well, I definitely think there are differences.",Claim
74461,And do you -- yeah.,None
74489,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.,Premise
74567,That's its most basic function.,Claim
74599,"And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.",Premise
74734,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.",Premise
74954,"Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",Premise
75140,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.",Claim
75225,"So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.",None
75572,That doesn't restrict people's freedom.,Claim
75612,That enhances it.,Premise
75630,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.,Premise
75708,And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.,Premise
75807,We use something called Race to the Top.,None
75848,"Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.",Premise
75886,"What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.",Premise
75967,"And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.",Premise
76060,"But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.",Premise
76236,And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.,Claim
76289,"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.",Claim
76439,"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",Premise
76537,"It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.",None
76587,And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.,None
76762,"Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government.",Premise
76812,Your view?,None
76832,"Well, first, I love great schools.",Premise
76867,"Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.",Claim
76934,"And the key to great schools, great teachers.",Premise
76980,So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.,Premise
77058,"Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.",Claim
77134,The role of government: Look behind us.,None
77174,The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.,Premise
77228,The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.,Claim
77322,"First, life and liberty.",Claim
77347,"We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.",None
77464,I do not believe in cutting our military.,Premise
77506,I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.,Premise
77567,"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.",Premise
77739,That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.,Premise
77848,"I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.",None
77990,"We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.",Premise
78187,We care for them.,Premise
78205,"And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.",Premise
78359,But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.,Claim
78528,"And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.",Premise
78710,And it's not working.,Premise
78733,And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.,Premise
78789,The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.,Premise
78840,The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.,Claim
78933,The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.,Claim
79028,All right.,None
79048,We know that the path we're taking is not working.,None
79099,It's time for a new path.,None
79134,All right.,None
79145,Let's go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government.,None
79243,How do -- education.,Claim
79264,Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?,Claim
79378,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.",Premise
79476,But the federal government also can play a very important role.,None
79540,"And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.",None
79739,The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.,Claim
79821,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.",Claim
79869,"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.",None
80109,"So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.",Premise
80338,"How do you see the federal government's responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?",Claim
80475,"Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",None
80548,"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.",Claim
80715,Do you think you have a difference with your views and -- and those of Governor Romney on -- about education and the federal government?,Premise
80860,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.",Premise
80933,"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",Premise
81160,"You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",None
81308,And it wasn't very detailed.,Claim
81337,This seems to be a trend.,Premise
81363,"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",Premise
81527,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.",None
81704,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...,None
81893,"Do you -- do you agree, Governor?",None
81935,Let me just finish the point.,Premise
81965,(CROSSTALK),Premise
81986,The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.,Claim
82063,And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.,Premise
82163,"That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.",None
82232,Let me just say one final example.,Premise
82267,"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.",Premise
82524,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.",Premise
82625,"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?""",Premise
82671,"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.",None
82820,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.,Claim
82887,"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.",None
83279,"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.",None

83770,I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.,Claim
83871,I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.,Claim

10870,Do you agree with Secretary Chu that this is not the job of the Energy Department?,Claim
10961,The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.,Premise
11039,So here's what I've done since I've been president.,Claim
11091,We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.,Claim
11159,Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.,Claim
11219,We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.,Premise
11282,But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.,Premise
11361,We've also got to look to the future.,Claim
11399,That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.,Premise
11456,"That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.",Premise
11585,That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.,Claim
11675,And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.,None
11778,"Now, I want to build on that.",Claim
11808,"And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.",Premise
11882,We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.,Claim
11948,"We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.",None
12055,And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.,Premise
12105,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.",Claim
12291,"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.",Premise
12434,"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.",Claim
12511,"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.",Premise
12664,"Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.",Premise
12722,And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.,Claim
12793,I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.,Premise
12873,That's going to help Jeremy get a job.,Premise
12912,It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.,None
12992,"Governor, on the subject of gas prices?",Premise
13041,"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.",Premise
13185,"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.",Claim
13291,"As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.",None
13412,Why?,Premise
13417,"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.",None
13540,So where'd the increase come from?,Claim
13575,Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.,None
13636,What was his participation there?,Claim
13670,"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.",None
13796,And what was the cost?,None
13819,20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.,Claim
13922,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.",Claim
14012,"I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.",Premise
14130,"But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.",None
14233,"This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.",None
14285,Talk to the people that are working in those industries.,None
14342,I was in coal country.,None
14365,"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job.""",None

14659,That's not the right course for America.,None
14701,"Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.",Claim
14801,"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.",Premise
15001,"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.",Claim
15105,I'll get America and North America energy independent.,Claim
15160,"I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.",Claim
15217,We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.,None
15268,How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?,Claim
15325,I will never know.,Premise
15345,"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.",None
15458,"Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal?",None
15581,"I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.",None
15736,"Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?",Claim
15853,"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.",None
15976,And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.,Premise
16035,We've opened up public lands.,Claim
16065,We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.,Premise
16195,And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.,Claim
16243,We're encouraging it and working with the industry.,None
16296,"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down.",None
16559,And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.,None
16608,So what I've tried to do is be consistent.,Claim
16651,"With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.",Claim
16838,"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.",Premise
16889,And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.,Claim
16965,"Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.",Premise
17100,And that's creating jobs.,Premise
17126,"That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.",Premise
17277,"That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.",Claim
17404,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.,Premise
17460,That's the problem.,Claim
17480,"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.",Claim
17585,"Not true, Governor Romney.",None

18526,"So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.",None

24651,And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.,Premise
24795,"You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.",Premise

25172,"Now, how about deductions?",Claim
25199,"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.",Claim
25460,The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.,Premise
25562,So that'll stay the same.,Claim
25589,Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.,Premise

28435,"So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.",Premise
28508,"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.",Claim
28622,I'm ready to sign that bill right now.,Premise
28661,The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.,None
28830,"But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.",Claim
28949,We created 23 million new jobs.,None
28981,That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.,Claim

29623,I think that grows the economy.,Claim
29655,I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.,Premise
29797,That grows our economy.,None
29822,So we just have a different theory.,Premise
29858,"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",Claim
30165,And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.,None
30331,"Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there.",None
30383,(LAUGHTER),None

30641,"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?",Premise

32543,"Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.",Claim

34307,"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.",Claim

43207,I think that's a mistake.,Claim
43233,"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.",Premise

78796,We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.,None

79282,"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.",Claim
79448,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.,Premise
79572,"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.",Claim
79855,But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.,Claim
79974,And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.,Claim
80083,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.,Premise
80155,But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.,Claim
80220,"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.",Claim
80328,They're using cheap hand guns.,None
80360,"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.",Premise
80616,And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.,Premise
80672,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.,None
80812,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.,Claim
80968,"Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.",Premise
81041,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.",Claim
81160,"We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.",Premise
81283,"What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.",Premise
81505,And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?,Premise
81553,And there are a number of things.,Claim
81587,He mentioned good schools.,None
81614,I totally agree.,Claim
81631,We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.,None
81709,"And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.",None
81868,But let me mention another thing.,Premise
81902,And that is parents.,Premise
81923,"We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.",Premise
81969,"Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.",Claim
82073,"A lot of great single moms, single dads.",Premise
82114,"But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.",Claim
82246,"Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.",Premise
82344,The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.,Claim
82432,"So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.",Premise
82590,The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.,Premise
82726,"Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.",Claim
82962,They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.,None
83056,And this was a -- this was a program of the government.,Premise
83112,"For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.",Claim
83167,But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.,Premise
83285,"Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.",None
83505,"I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.",None
83665,Candy?,None
83683,"Governor, Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were once banned and are no longer banned.",None
83813,"I know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in Massachusetts, obviously, with this question, you no longer do support that.",None
83953,"Why is that, given the kind of violence that we see sometimes with these mass killings?",Premise
84041,Why is it that you have changed your mind?,Premise
84094,"Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.",Premise
84226,"And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.",Claim
84430,"There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.",Claim
84587,"That's what we need more of, Candy.",None
84623,What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.,None
84701,"So I could -- if you could get people to agree to it, you would be for it?",None
84785,We have --,Claim
84804,Candy?,Premise
84820,-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.,None
84898,I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.,Claim
84972,"Quickly, Mr. President.",Premise
85004,"The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.",None
85106,"And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.",Premise
85242,So that's on the record.,Premise
85267,"But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.",Premise
85496,We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.,Claim
85615,"But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.",Premise
85782,"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.",Claim
86075,We're starting to see gains in math and science.,Premise
86125,"When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.",Claim
86395,"And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.",Claim
86451,And so we're matching them up.,Claim
86482,Giving them access to higher education.,None
86522,"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.",None

88176,A lot of good people have lost jobs.,None
88213,A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.,Claim
88288,That's total over the last four years.,Premise
88327,One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.,Claim
88445,We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.,Claim
88545,What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.,Premise
88634,This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.,Premise

88864,"Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.",Claim
88939,"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.",Premise
89090,"Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.",Claim
89193,And China hasn't.,Premise
89211,One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.,Claim
89339,"Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.",None
89432,And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.,Claim
89486,We lose sales.,Claim
89501,And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.,Premise

89753,"On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.",None

8345,"We'll get to that, but let's give the president a chance.",None
8411,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.",Claim

51369,"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.",Premise
51424,They are not true.,Claim
51443,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.,Claim
51583,"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.",Premise
51681,There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.,Premise
51795,"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.",Claim
51916,It's very straightforward.,None
51943,And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.,None

52255,And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.,Claim
52351,It's meticulous.,Claim
52368,We started from the day we got into office.,Premise
52412,"And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.",Premise
52648,Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.,Premise
52745,It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.,Claim
52822,And we've got to maintain that pressure.,Claim
52864,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.",Premise
52968,They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.,Premise

53325,The clock is ticking.,Premise
53347,We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.,Claim
53434,And I've been very clear to them.,Premise
53468,"You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.",Premise
53724,And that clock is ticking.,Premise
53751,"And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.",Claim
53957,Governor?,None
53976,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",Claim
54171,I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.,Claim
54248,"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.",Premise
54505,"And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.",Claim
54624,"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.",Premise
54761,I think they looked at that and saw weakness.,Claim
54808,"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.",Premise
54954,I think they noticed that as well.,Claim
54990,"And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.",Claim
55126,"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.",Claim
55324,"Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.",Premise
55456,"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.",Claim
55623,And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.,Claim
55679,They must not develop nuclear capability.,Claim
55721,"And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.",Claim
55839,They need to be tightened.,Claim
55866,Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.,Claim
55912,We need to indict Ahmadinejad.,Claim
55943,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",Claim
56082,"Bob, let me just respond.",None
56108,"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",Claim
56196,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.,Premise
56292,"And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.",Premise
56392,"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.",Claim
56517,"And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.",Premise
56742,"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.",None
56888,"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.",Claim
57112,And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.,Claim
57232,"When I came into office, the world was divided.",Premise
57280,Iran was resurgent.,Premise
57300,"Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.",Premise

57610,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,Premise
57610,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,Claim
57696,And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.,None
57852,That's number one.,Premise
57871,"Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.",Premise
58040,"And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.",Claim
58146,"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.",Premise
58200,"And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.",Premise
58301,You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.,Claim

59253,"So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.",None
59346,And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?,Premise
59461,"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.",Claim
59693,And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.,Claim
59823,And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.,None

62425,"I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",Premise

66820,They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.,Claim
66902,"And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.",Claim
67022,And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.,Claim
67170,And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.,Claim
67306,"So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.",None

67619,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.",Premise
67723,That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.,Claim
67790,And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.,Claim
67899,Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.,Premise
67960,"We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.",Premise
68042,And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.,Premise

68430,"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.",Claim
68603,But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.,Premise
68726,"And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",Premise

69781,All right.,None
69792,Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.,None
69888,"General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan.",None
70023,We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama (sic) bin Laden.,None

70212,Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan?,Premise
70261,"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.",Premise

71239,And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.,Claim
71343,We -- we had to go into Pakistan.,Claim
71377,We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.,Claim
71423,That was the right thing to do.,Premise
71455,"And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.",Claim
71547,But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.,Premise
71704,And it's important for them.,Premise
71733,It's important for the nuclear weapons.,Premise
71773,It's important for the success of Afghanistan.,Premise

71914,They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.,Premise
71979,And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.,Claim
72094,But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.,Claim
72177,"But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.",None
72370,"Let -- let me ask you, Governor because we know President Obama's position on this, what is -- what is your position on the use of drones?",Claim
72518,Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.,Claim
72652,"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",Claim
72965,"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.",Claim
73131,We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.,Claim
73276,We haven't done that yet.,Premise

73639,"No, they haven't had talks in two years.",Claim
73680,"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",Claim
73930,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.",Premise
73997,"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.",Premise
74101,"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.",Claim
74493,"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.",Claim
74576,And we have stood on the side of democracy.,Premise
74621,"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.",Premise
74796,In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.,Premise
74841,In Libya we stood on the side of the people.,Claim
74887,"And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.",Premise
74971,But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.,Premise
75077,And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.,Claim
75160,But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.,Claim
75257,"The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.",Premise
75345,And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.,None
75468,"Let's -- let's go to the next segment, because it's a very important one.",None
75542,It is the rise of China and future challenges for America.,None
75601,"I want to just begin this by asking both of you, and Mr. President, you -- you go first this time.",None
75700,What do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?,Claim
75801,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",Claim
75858,"We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.",Claim
75902,"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.",Claim
76046,So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.,Premise
76166,I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.,Premise
76301,And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.,Premise
76413,That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.,Premise
76571,"And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.",Premise
76657,"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.",Premise
76818,We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.,Claim
76927,And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.,Premise
77003,I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.,Premise
77175,"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.",Premise
77226,They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.,Claim
77322,"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.",Claim
77477,"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.",Claim
77706,"And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",None
77828,All right.,None
77839,Governor?,Claim
77859,"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.",Claim
77931,It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.,Claim
78007,"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.",None
78129,Let's talk about China.,Claim
78153,"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.",Claim
78256,They don't want war.,Claim
78277,They don't want to see protectionism.,Premise
78315,"They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.",Claim
78604,So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.,Claim
78672,And so we can be a partner with China.,Claim
78711,"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.",Claim
78771,"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.",None
78863,"Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?",None
78931,How strong are we going to be?,None
78962,How strong is our economy?,None
78989,"They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.",None

79197,A trillion dollars.,Premise
79217,The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.,Premise

79668,"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.",Claim
79740,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.,Premise
79819,"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.",Premise
80027,It holds down the prices of their goods.,Premise
80068,It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.,Claim
80127,That's got to end.,Premise
80147,They're making some progress; they need to make more.,Claim
80201,"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.",Premise
80326,"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.",Claim
80467,They have to understand we want to trade with them.,Claim
80519,We want a world that's stable.,Claim
80550,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.",None
80622,"Well, Governor, let me just ask you.",None
80659,"If you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are -- say you're just going to start a trade war with China on day one.",None
80799,Is that -- isn't there a risk that that could happen?,Premise
80862,"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.",Claim
80966,So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.,Claim
81017,"And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.",Premise
81083,It's a silent one.,Claim
81102,And they're winning.,Premise
81123,"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.",Claim
81256,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.,Claim
81350,"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.",None
81430,We understand it.,None
81448,But this can't keep on going.,Premise

82576,"And, you know, that's -- you're right.",Premise
82615,I mean that's how our free market works.,Claim
82656,But I've made a different bet on American workers.,Claim
82708,"If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.",Premise
82843,If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.,Claim
83026,"Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.",Claim

83601,We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.,Premise
83691,"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.",Claim

84131,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.",Premise
84256,And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.,Premise

84471,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.,None
84540,"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.",None
